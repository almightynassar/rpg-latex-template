  \section*{Broken Stars: Players guide}

  \begin{multicols}{2}

  \addtocounter{section}{1}

  Welcome to the Black, adventurer! 
        
  The year is 3210 and, despite all of the set-backs, humanity has streched out across the stars. We first escaped our ancient Cradle (an affectionate space-name for Earth) using simple "propulsion thrusters", and we terraformed and colonised the entire star system in just a few centuries. During this time we probably also figured out how to do \textit{real} artificial intelligence, put computers inside our brains, make laser weapons, and all of the other cool technology we use in our everyday lives.
        
  But the game-changer came with the invention of the Trans-Dimensional Drive, or TDD for short. This special machine allowed us to bend the laws of Space-Time for Faster Than Light (FTL) travel using what the tech-heads call "trans-dimensional energy". The TDD allowed us simple apes to escape the gravity of Sol and \textit{really} explore the big ol' Black.

  Civilisation continued to expand with each new colony founded, alien species encountered, and star sector charted. We started to link everything together using gigantic Jump Portals that allowed ships without their own TDD engine to travel at FTL speeds. The Black slowly fell to our ever-expanding hunger.
  
  We became so reliant on TDD technology that eventually people began to experience side-effects. When you are exposed to trans-dimensional energy for long periods of time you begin to change. Some lucky individuals developed the ability to manipulate Space-Time itself, while others became malformed or simply driven mad. These people became known as psionics, psychics, paranorms, or jsingshen. Whole Research Centres were made to study and train psionics so that their abilities could be used to stretch out even further across the stars.

  And then it all came crashing down.
        
  We call it \textit{The Surge}. It was a large shockwave of energy that exploded from deep within the center of the galaxy, sweeping across and overloading everything that used trans-dimensional energy. In a matter of seconds we lost our Jump Portals, TDD engines and even psionics to the Surge.

  In the aftermath, some worlds began to starve without the trade network built on FTL travel. Others slid into barbarism as they fought over dwindling resources. Countless worlds began their struggle for survival due to their sudden isolation. And the remaining Psionics had to learn to safely harness their powers without the guidance of experienced mentors.

  But over the last few centuries we have begun to rebuild. We turn our eyes to the edges of the Black once again. Warlords and petty tyrants scheme to expand their stellar domain. Reclaimers plunder the ruins of worlds that did not survive. Trade routes have been revived through the use of the Intra-Dimensional Drive (IDD), a less performant but safer derivative of the TDD. And Psionics practice their skills away from the distrustful eyes of those who see the use of trans-dimensional energy as an imminent threat to civilisation.

  \textbf{Good luck out in the Black!}

  \section{Character Creation}
  
  Character creation mostly follows the rules set out in the \textbf{Savage Worlds} rulebook with a few setting specific alterations. We will provide a brief reference here but we urge you to consult the rulebook if you wish to clarify a rule or two.
        
  \begin{enumerate}

    \item \textbf{Species}: The default species is human, although you can choose to play one of the many alien species.
    \noindent
    \begin{standardtable}{\linewidth}{sb}
      \textbf{Species} & \textbf{Description}\\
      Ay-Matak & Avian alien species that love to travel and experience life.\\
      Bots & Ranges from androids, robots, Ghosts, and everything in between.\\
      Ghantak & Insectiod alien species that are tradition and honour-bound.\\
      Ghoa & Violent and combative mammalian-reptilian hybrid alien species.\\
      Human & Stock-standard genetically unaltered human descended from Earth.\\
      Kaj & Intelligent grey-skinned humanoid alien species.\\
      Pluvma & Multi-limbed alien species that are drawn to the weird and quirky.\\
      Uplifted & Genetically-altered Earth animals that have been spliced with human DNA.\\
    \end{standardtable}

    \item \textbf{Attributes}: You start with a d4 in each attribute and have 5 points with which to raise them. Raising an attribute by one die type costs 1 point (but you cannot raise an attribute above a d12).
    \begin{standardtable}{\linewidth}{sb}
      \textbf{Attribute} & \textbf{Description}\\
      Strength & Raw physical power and general fitness.\\
      Agility & Nimbleness, quickness and dexterity..\\
      Smarts & Mental agility and your knowledge about the worlds that inhabit the Black.\\
      Spirit & Inner wisdom and willpower.\\
      Vigor & Endurance and a measure of how much pain and physical damage you can shake off.\\
    \end{standardtable}

    \item \textbf{Skills}: You have 15 points for skills. Each die type in a skill costs 1 point up to the linked attribute. Going over the linked attribute costs 2 points per level. A seperate list of skills is provided in it's own section.

    \item \textbf{Derived Traits}: Calculate your derived traits according using your attributes and skills.
    \begin{standardtable}{\linewidth}{sb}
      \textbf{Trait} & \textbf{Description}\\
      Charisma & Calculated as: (Spirit / 2) - 4. General likeability and manners, and is added to all persuasion and streetwise rolls.\\
      Pace & Calculated as: (Strength / 2) + 2. How many squares of movement you can take during your turn.\\
      Parry & Calculated as: (Fighting / 2) + 2. Target number for melee combat or against ranged weapons within melee range.\\
      Toughness & Calculated as: (Vigor / 2) + 2. Add armour on top of toughness.\\
    \end{standardtable}

    \item \textbf{Hindrances}: You can choose to gain additional character creation points by taking up to \textbf{one} Major Hindrace (2 points) and up to \textbf{two} Minor Hindrances (1 point each). 
    \begin{itemize}
        \item For 2 points you can gain another attribute point or choose an \textbf{Edge}. 
        \item For 1 point you can gain another skill point or increase starting funds by 100%.
    \end{itemize}
            
    \item \textbf{Edges}: Edges are what sets your character apart from everyone else. There are 3 main paths to choose from:    
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Standard}: Just use the normal Edge list. 
        \item \textbf{Psionic}: Take the \textit{Psionic Background} edge and manipulate Space-Time.
        \item \textbf{Cyberware}: Take the \textit{Warez Background} edge and meld flesh with machine.
    \end{itemize}

    \item \textbf{Gear}: All characters start with 750 Credits to buy their equipment with.

    \item \textbf{Background Detail}: Fill in any other details of your character's background.

  \end{enumerate}

  \section{Species}

  \subsection{Ay-Matak}
  
  \begin{redtable}{\linewidth}{sb}
    \textbf{Height} & 135-170cm\\
    \textbf{Weight} & 35-50kg\\
    \textbf{Gender Ratio} & 40\% Male / 60\% Female\\
    \textbf{Reproduction} & Oviparity (Eggs)\\
    \textbf{Diet} & Omnivore\\
    \textbf{Homeworld} & Matak (Lost)\\
  \end{redtable}

  The Ay-Matak (\textit{plural: Ay-Matakian}) are an alien species that have evolved from the birds native to their homeworld of Matak. They typically shorter and lighter than humans, have two pairs of wings, are bi-pedal, and have two arms with opposable thumbs on each of their hands. The beak is solid and sharp along the sides, with the tip made out of softer material that is flexible enough to produce a variety of sounds. The plumage of a male Ay-Matak is always more colourful than the female (who are limited to whites, greys and blacks).

  Their homeworld of Matak has been lost, leaving many Ay-Matak have been stranded across the black. Legend has it that Matak was reknowned for its tall trees that almost touched the edges of the atmosphere. It also had a rich ecosystem that meant the Ay-Matak enjoyed an overabundance of food and had little need to compete for limited resources. Because of this the Ay-Matak were able to fully indulge in the pleasures of life. The Ay-Matak place a high social value on the arts (especially those that use an abundance of colour or visual stimuli), travel, and new ideas.

  Planets with a majority of Ay-Matak are usually formed under an Oligarchic government. The members of the government are generally influential elders who have contributed greatly to the culture of the planet, or have travelled far and wide in search of new ideas.

  Ay-Matakian characters have the following traits:
  \begin{standardtable}{\linewidth}{sb}
    \textbf{Flight} & Can fly at their basic Pace and even "run" while flying. It cost 2 squares of Pace to gain 1 square of height.\\
    \textbf{Hollow-boned} & -1 toughness.\\
    \textbf{Free Edge} & Start with one free Novice Edge of their choice, regardless of requirements (except those that require other Edges).\\
  \end{standardtable}
  
  \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{bird_race_f_concept_by_luigiix-d52w3as}
  
  \textbf{Male Names}: Andomion, Antakon, Artenaeon, Demoleo, Dralop, Entardion, Eraton, Eratro, Heliodo, Ikotu, Kalipon, Koron, Lokinu, Melaleimon, Myrodon, Panolio, Taramio, Teladon, Tridru, Tyrorion
  
  \textbf{Female Names}: Agara, Alanie, Aldorria, Anakia, Atria, Bellaleta, Belliana, Hallia, Iripira, Karellia, Katia, Kynie, Laleta, Nerian, Nolanta, Obemona, Peneleta, Talitian, Tiakia, Utriema
  
  \textbf{Secondary Names}: Ay-Matak do not take family names, but instead earn cultural "\textit{titles}" for their last well-known greatest achievement. For example, \textit{Andomion, painter of 'Matak Lost'}. Those without a great achievement usually go by their occupation, birthplace, spacecraft name, or include the name of their mother ("\textit{hatchling of Anakia}"). Needless to say that many an Ay-Matak have caused headaches for human bureacrats.
  
  \columnbreak

  \subsection{Bot/Shell}
  
  \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{BEzZuPdCEAAgcr8}

  A common sight on any technologically-advanced society is the large number of Bots and machines performing menial yet necessary labour. Most of these machines are limited to a singular purpose and have a "weak AI". But technology has advanced far enough that some robots can be programmed to display human-like cognitive abilities. These Bots are considered to have "strong AI", and are used for highly specialised and complex work.
  
  On the other end of the spectrum are individuals who have made the transition from organic to mechanical. These individuals, known as Ghosts, have chosen to digitise their conciousness and memory and upload themselves into artificial bodies known as Shells. Many in society believe that these digitised conciousnesses have lost their basic "humanity", and are indistinguishable from normal AI. 
        
  Bot and Shell characters have the following traits:
  \begin{standardtable}{\linewidth}{sb}
    \textbf{Construct} & Add +2 to recover from being Shaken, do not suffer wound modifiers, and are immune to poison and disease. They cannot Heal naturally, and require the Repair skill to remove wounds (use like the Healing skill).\\
    \textbf{Artificial} & Organic races often mistrust and misunderstand Bots and Shells. -2 to Charisma when dealing with races other than their own.\\
    \textbf{Programming} & Start with one free d6 in one skill, representing their original programmed role of your chassis.\\
    \textbf{Recharge} & If you cannot access a power source at least once a day, suffer one point of Fatigue each day until incapacitated. The day after that, you go "off-line" and must be revivied with a Repair roll and a four-hour charge. This replaces the need for food and water, unless food and water is selected as the power source.\\
  \end{standardtable}
  
  \begin{commentbox}{Playing as a Bot}
  \textit{Swapping Bodies}: Since you are a digital conciousness (Ghost or AGI), you may decide to change your form-factor for a chassis more suited to the task at hand (after acquiring it, of course). You will experience disorientation as you get used to your new chassis. The settling period usually occurs over a few days (at the GM's discretion), after which you will be totally fluent in the capabilities of your new body. Once you have changed bodies, replace your original "\textit{Programming}" ability with another one more suited to your new chassis. You may also have a new power source.
  
  \textit{Hacking}: Hacking and reprogramming a Bot is a very complex task. It will generally require the Hacker to access a physical IO port (most computer and electronic systems guard against remote entry), which is best accessed if the Bot is incapacitated. Then the Hacker needs to open the IO port (Hacker's Repair vs Bot's Toughness), and then break the software Firewalls (Hacker's Security opposed by the Bot's Spirit).
  
  \textit{Artificial}: Most organic beings have an inherent distrust of AGI and see the machines as a threat. Machines are depicted (rightly or wrongly) as unfeeling, ruthlessly efficient, and simply cannot "get it". Characters will generally prefer to deal with an organic "master", and are wary of any machine that claims it is operating independently.

  \subsection{Ghantak}
  
  \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{bruno-camara-beetle-brunocamara}
  
  \begin{redtable}{\linewidth}{sb}
    \textbf{Height} & 135-170cm\\
    \textbf{Weight} & 50-80kg\\
    \textbf{Gender Ratio} & 90\% Genderless / 9\% Male / 1\% Female\\
    \textbf{Reproduction} & Ovuliparity (External egg fetilisation egg)\\
    \textbf{Diet} & Herbivore\\
    \textbf{Homeworld} & Ghan\\
  \end{redtable}
        
  The Ghantak (\textit{plural: Ghantakian}) are an alien species evolved from the beetle-like insects native to their homeworld of Ghan. They are shorter than humans but weigh about the same, have an armoured carapace that covers their whole body, and their head is between the shoulders where the human chest would be. The odd placement for a Ghantakian head means that they must turn their whole body to look around.
  
  Although each individual has their own free will, the Ghantak as a species have an innate tendancy to organise themselves into highly-structured hierachies. Most Ghantak highly value honour and tradition, with personal sacrifice to uphold Ghantakian values earning an individual glory and esteem. The race generally favours traditional solutions to problems, and individuals are uncomfortable when forced to exercise their own judgement.
  
  While there used to be multiple independant hierarchies (each with their own Queen), the entire modern Ghantakian society is now ruled by a singular Empress. The Empress is chosen from the Queens of the remaining hierarchies and she rules until her death.
         
  Ghantakian characters have the following traits:
  \begin{standardtable}{\linewidth}{sb}
    \textbf{Carapace} & You have an armoured carapace that protects you from harm. +2 Armour.\\
    \textbf{Caste-based} & Start with one free d6 in one skill, representing your designated role in Ghantakian society.\\
    \textbf{Reputable} & Your species is seen as dependable, loyal and predictable. +2 charisma when dealing with characters who have heard of the Ghantak before.\\
  \end{standardtable}
    
  \columnbreak

  \subsection{Ghoa}
      
  \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{alien_reptile_concept_by_xjager513-d3ba4g7.jpg}
    
  You are an alien that has evolved from reptiles native to your planet. Your species are typically tribal, putting tribe ahead of all other social groups (including the species as a whole). Their chief mode of expression is anger, and are prone to acts of wanton violence. Disputes are traditionally resolved through force (though rarely to the death). The prospect of death rarely intimidates the Ghoa, and some actively embrace it. Their political system is based on the tribe that the Ghoa is a part of. 
    
  Ghoan characters have the following traits:
  \begin{standardtable}{\linewidth}{sb}
    \textbf{Bloodthirsty} & Ghoa are cruel to their foes, rarely take prisoners, and feel little compunction about punishing captured enemies. This causes a -4 Charisma penalty when dealing with "civilised" worlds that know of the Ghoa.\\
    \textbf{Natural Weapons} & The Ghoa use their tails, claws and teeth as weapons, dealing Str+d6 damage.\\
    \textbf{Tribal Warriors} & Their willingness to use violence to solve all problems mean that the Ghoa start with a d6 instead of a d4 in the Fighting skill.\\
  \end{standardtable}
    
  \columnbreak

  \subsection{Human}
  
  \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{TCP-Pirate-2}
  
  You are a standard human, with a genetic lineage tracing all the way back to Sol.
  
  Humans have the following traits:
  \begin{standardtable}{\linewidth}{sb}
    \textbf{Free Edge} & Start with one free Novice Edge of their choice, regardless of requirements (except those that require other Edges).\\

  \subsection{Uplifted}
      
  You are an alien that has evolved from the felines native to your planet. Upliftedns are an extremely prideful species, and regard all other alien races as inferior to themselves. This pride drives a need to conquer and rule (both their own and other species).
      
  Uplifted animals have the following traits:
  \begin{standardtable}{\linewidth}{sb}
    \textbf{Inferior} & Many see the Uplifted as inferior to other species that have evolved naturally. -2 Charisma when other characters deal with the Uplifted.\\
    \textbf{Primal senses} & +2 to notice checks.\\
    \textbf{Primal Weapons} & You still have claws, teeth and other leftovers from your primitive state. These weapons do Str+d6 damage.\\

  \section{Psionics}

  \begin{multicols}{2}

  Psionics have been granted special abilities due to the side-effects of TDD technology. They can manipulate matter, create fire, and some even say they can alter time. A new Psionic starts off with 3 powers at the Novice level.

  As a psionic, when you wish to cast a power you must make a Psionic skill roll. You must apply all penalties noted in the table entry, including wound and fatigue penalites. You cast the power on a success (with additional benefits on a raise), but if you fail the skill roll you cancel all currently maintained powers and you are Shaken.

  Some additional notes regarding powers:

    \item \textbf{Backlash}: If you roll a 1 on the Psionic skill die (regardless of the Wild Die), your power automatically fails and you suffer 2d6 damage. All sentient creatures within a Large Burst (6 diameter) centered on the Psionic also suffer 2d6 damage.

    \item \textbf{Brainburn}: If you roll a 1 on the Psionic skill die (regardless of the Wild Die), you are automatically Shaken. On a Critical Failure, you let out a psychic Surge that causes all allies within a Large Burst (6 diameter) to be Shaken as well (if they fail their Spirit roll). This can cause a wound.

    \item \textbf{Concentration}: Some powers are listed as "Concentration" and can last as long as desired. Each new power maintained inflicts a -1 to cast any new powers. Thus a Shielded Psionic can keep the power going indefinitely, but suffers a -1 penalty if they then attempt to create a Blast.

    \item \textbf{Interrupting Powers}: If a character with an activated power is Shaken or suffers a wound or Fatigue level, they must make a Smarts roll to maintain all of their powers. If the roll is failed, all powers are instantly dropped. Powers stop automatically if the psionic sleeps or is rendered unconcious.

    \item \textbf{Power Preperation}: A psionic may prepare a spell by concentrating for a round (no movement or other actions and avoid interruptions). If successful, they ignore 2 points of penalties on all powers cast with their next action. If they do not enact any powers on their next action, the preparation is lost.

  \begin{multicols}{2}

  \begin{itemize}

    \item \textbf{AGI}: Artificial General Intelligence or "\textit{strong AI}". An AI that has cognitive faculties comparable to a human or higher.

    \item \textbf{AI}: Artificial Intelligence. Generally used for "\textit{weak AI}", or specialised AI that do not encompass the full range human-level cognitive abilities.

    \item \textbf{AR}: Augmented Reality. Information that is overlaid onto your real-world senses. AR data is usually visual, but can also be audio, tactile, olfactory, kinesthetic (body awareness), emotional, and other senses.

    \item \textbf{Ay-Matak}: (\textit{plural: Ay-Matakian}) Alien race that has evolved from birds native to their planet. The species have an innate wanderlust, and are never happy staying in one place too long. They place high social value in the areas of art, pleasure and excitement. Their political system is based on oligarchic rule by influential elders.

    \item \textbf{Black}: Slang term for space.

    \item \textbf{Cortical Stack}: An implanted electronic data storage used for memory and personality backups. Located where the spine meets the skull. Commonly known as a "\textit{Stack}".

    \item \textbf{Cradle}: Slang term for Earth. Location is currently unknown.

    \item \textbf{Credit}: Standard interchangeable monetary unit accepted by most space-faring worlds. Issued as either electronic banking entries, or embedded onto physical electronic chips. Some primitive worlds use "notes" made of plastic or paper.

    \item \textbf{Cyberware}: Generic term for the neural interface technology that melds metal and flesh into a coherent whole. This technology enables AR, Cortical Stacks, Ghosts in their Shells, and Sim-Sense. Commonly known as a "\textit{Warez}".

    \item \textbf{ECM}: Electronic Counter Measures. A suit of electronic tools designed to target and cripple enemy sensors to make you almost impossible to track and hit. Commonly known as a "\textit{E-War}" or "\textit{iWar}".

    \item \textbf{FTL}: Faster-Than-Light.

    \item \textbf{Ghantak}: (\textit{plural: Ghantakian}) Alien species that have evolved from beetle-like insects native to their planet. The species place a high value on honour and tradition, with a singular Queen ruling over the entire species. Personal sacrifice for the sake of upholding Ghantakian values earns you glory and esteem. The race favours traditional solutions to problems, and individuals are uncomfortable when forced to exercise their own judgement.

    \item \textbf{Ghoa}: (\textit{plural: Ghoan}) Alien species that have evolved from an unusual mammal-reptile hybrid native to their planet. The species are typically tribal, putting their tribe ahead of all other social groups (including the species as a whole). Their chief mode of expression is anger, and the Ghoa are prone to acts of wanton violence. Disputes are traditionally resolved through force (rarely to the death). Some Ghoa actively embrace the honour and glory of death in battle. Their political system is based entirely upon the tribe that the Ghoa is a part of.

    \item \textbf{Ghost}: Slang term used for a digitised persona. Some individuals have used Cortical Stacks to make a digital copy of themselves. These copies exist on digital hardware or in artifical bodies known as Shells. There is debate on whether these copies are really "people" or just another AGI.

    \item \textbf{IDD}: Intra-Dimensional Drive. Spaceship engine used to achieve FTL speeds based on TDD technology. To guard against another Surge-like event, IDD only manipulates Space-Time within a precisely defined spectrum. TDD does not have this limitation, and therefore TDD technology is vastly superior in performance and achievable FTL speeds.

    \item \textbf{Jump Portal}: Large gateways that used TDD technology to allow large cargo ships to travel at FTL speeds. All known portals are currently defective and inoperable.

    \item \textbf{Muse}: Slang for personal AI helper programs.

    \item \textbf{Psionic}: An individual adversely affected by trans-dimensional energy. Some have been granted the ability to manipulate Space-Time, while others become malformed and driven mad. Also known as psychics, paranorms, and jsingshen.

    \item \textbf{Propulsion Thruster}: Conventional spacecraft engine that propels energy away from the spacecraft to create thrust. Used for interplanetary travel within a star system.

    \item \textbf{Reclaimers}: Euphemistic slang for scavengers. These individuals search and scour the Black for salvageable ruins.

    \item \textbf{Shell}: Slang term for an artificial body. These bodies can either be synthetic or biological. There is debate on whether these Shells are really "people" or just another Bot.

    \item \textbf{Sim-sense}: Experiencing someone else's sensory input (in real-time or recorded).

    \item \textbf{Space-Time}: The concepts of time and three-dimensional space fused in a four-dimensional continuum.

    \item \textbf{Splicer}: Slang for an individual that has undergone extensive genetic modification and transformation.

    \item \textbf{Surge}: A mysterious event that overloaded all technology that utilised trans-dimensional energy.

    \item \textbf{TDD}: Trans-Dimensional Drive. Heavy utilised technology that bends Space-Time to achieve FTL travel. A side effect is the creation of psionics.

    \item \textbf{Tech-Level}: Standard technology classification for worlds. There are seven tech-levels, ranging from 0 (stone-age) to 6 (advanced technology exceeding anything from pre-Surge civilisation)

    \item \textbf{Trans-dimensional energy}: A form of energy that is the by-product of manipulating the multiple dimensions of Space-Time by collapsing and bending it. Not much is known about this energy despite it's importance to IDD and TDD technology.

    \item \textbf{Uplifted}: Animals that are biologically and geneticatlly engineered to have higher intelligence and sentience.

    \item \textbf{Xenomorph}: Alien life form. Also "\textit{xeno}", and includes the Ay-Matak, Ghantak, Ghoa, Kaj and Pluvma.
