\begin{multicols}{2}

  \begin{itemize}

    \item \textbf{AGI}: Artificial General Intelligence or "\textit{strong AI}". An AI that has cognitive faculties comparable to a human or higher.

    \item \textbf{AI}: Artificial Intelligence. Generally used for "\textit{weak AI}", or specialised AI that do not encompass the full range human-level cognitive abilities.

    \item \textbf{AR}: Augmented Reality. Information that is overlaid onto your real-world senses. AR data is usually visual, but can also be audio, tactile, olfactory, kinesthetic (body awareness), emotional, and other senses.

    \item \textbf{Ay-Matak}: (\textit{plural: Ay-Matakian}) Alien race that has evolved from birds native to their planet. The species have an innate wanderlust, and are never happy staying in one place too long. They place high social value in the areas of art, pleasure and excitement. Their political system is based on oligarchic rule by influential elders.

    \item \textbf{Black}: Slang term for space.

    \item \textbf{Core system}: A system in the Shangra Omega system that is part of the United Systems.

    \item \textbf{Cortical Stack}: An implanted electronic data storage used for memory and personality backups. Located where the spine meets the skull. Commonly known as a "\textit{Stack}".

    \item \textbf{Cradle}: Slang term for Earth. Location is currently unknown.

    \item \textbf{Credit}: Standard interchangeable monetary unit accepted by most space-faring worlds. Issued as either electronic banking entries, or embedded onto physical electronic chips. Some primitive worlds use "notes" made of plastic or paper.

    \item \textbf{Cyberware}: Generic term for the neural interface technology that melds metal and flesh into a coherent whole. This technology enables AR, Cortical Stacks, Ghosts in their Shells, and Sim-Sense. Commonly known as a "\textit{Warez}".

    \item \textbf{ECM}: Electronic Counter Measures. A suit of electronic tools designed to target and cripple enemy sensors to make you almost impossible to track and hit. Commonly known as a "\textit{E-War}" or "\textit{iWar}".

    \item \textbf{FTL}: Faster-Than-Light.

    \item \textbf{Ghantak}: (\textit{plural: Ghantakian}) Alien species that have evolved from beetle-like insects native to their planet. The species place a high value on honour and tradition, with a singular Queen ruling over the entire species. Personal sacrifice for the sake of upholding Ghantakian values earns you glory and esteem. The race favours traditional solutions to problems, and individuals are uncomfortable when forced to exercise their own judgement.

    \item \textbf{Ghan system}: The three star systems that include the native home of the Ghantak.

    \item \textbf{Ghoa}: (\textit{plural: Ghoan}) Alien species that have evolved from an unusual mammal-reptile hybrid native to their planet. The species are typically tribal, putting their tribe ahead of all other social groups (including the species as a whole). Their chief mode of expression is anger, and the Ghoa are prone to acts of wanton violence. Disputes are traditionally resolved through force (rarely to the death). Some Ghoa actively embrace the honour and glory of death in battle. Their political system is based entirely upon the tribe that the Ghoa is a part of.

    \item \textbf{Ghost}: Slang term used for a digitised persona. Some individuals have used Cortical Stacks to make a digital copy of themselves. These copies exist on digital hardware or in artifical bodies known as Shells. There is debate on whether these copies are really "people" or just another AGI.

    \item \textbf{IDD}: Intra-Dimensional Drive. Spaceship engine used to achieve FTL speeds based on TDD technology. To guard against another Surge-like event, IDD only manipulates Space-Time within a precisely defined spectrum. TDD does not have this limitation, and therefore TDD technology is vastly superior in performance and achievable FTL speeds.

    \item \textbf{Independent system}: A star system that chooses, for various reasons, to remain seperate from the United Systems.

    \item \textbf{Jump Portal}: Large gateways that used TDD technology to allow large cargo ships to travel at FTL speeds. All known portals are currently defective and inoperable.

    \item \textbf{Lost system}: A star system that is rumoured to still exist. Travellers tell of it's existance, but no formal expedition has been commissioned to verify the tails.

    \item \textbf{Muse}: Slang for personal AI helper programs.

    \item \textbf{Psionic}: An individual adversely affected by trans-dimensional energy. Some have been granted the ability to manipulate Space-Time, while others become malformed and driven mad. Also known as psychics, paranorms, and jsingshen.

    \item \textbf{Propulsion Thruster}: Conventional spacecraft engine that propels energy away from the spacecraft to create thrust. Used for interplanetary travel within a star system.

    \item \textbf{Reclaimers}: Euphemistic slang for scavengers. These individuals search and scour the Black for salvageable ruins.

    \item \textbf{Shangra Omega}: The name of the sector of the Black this setting takes place in. Nicknames includes "\textit{Shangra}", "\textit{Shomega}", and "\textit{Shang-o}".

    \item \textbf{Shell}: Slang term for an artificial body. These bodies can either be synthetic or biological. There is debate on whether these Shells are really "people" or just another Bot.

    \item \textbf{Sim-sense}: Experiencing someone else's sensory input (in real-time or recorded).

    \item \textbf{Space-Time}: The concepts of time and three-dimensional space fused in a four-dimensional continuum.

    \item \textbf{Splicer}: Slang for an individual that has undergone extensive genetic modification and transformation.

    \item \textbf{Surge}: A mysterious event that overloaded all technology that utilised trans-dimensional energy.

    \item \textbf{TDD}: Trans-Dimensional Drive. Heavy utilised technology that bends Space-Time to achieve FTL travel. A side effect is the creation of psionics.

    \item \textbf{Tech-Level}: Standard technology classification for worlds. There are seven tech-levels, ranging from 0 (stone-age) to 6 (advanced technology exceeding anything from pre-Surge civilisation)

    \item \textbf{Trans-dimensional energy}: A form of energy that is the by-product of manipulating the multiple dimensions of Space-Time by collapsing and bending it. Not much is known about this energy despite it's importance to IDD and TDD technology.

    \item \textbf{United Systems}: A loose alliance of star systems that share a common legal and military framework.

    \item \textbf{Uplifted}: Animals that are biologically and geneticatlly engineered to have higher intelligence and sentience.

    \item \textbf{Xenomorph}: Alien life form. Also "\textit{xeno}", and includes the Ay-Matak, Ghantak, Ghoa, Kaj and Pluvma.
