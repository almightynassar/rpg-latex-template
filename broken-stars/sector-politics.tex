\subsubsection{Organised Religions}

\begin{genericsection}{Earth Standard}
Earth Standard is a loose classification for any religious system that can trace it's roots back to Earth. Religious belief is one of the few things people hang on to when trying to survive, and many stubbornly refuse to change. These religious beliefs are usually passed down from close family members or friends. Religions include Buddhism, Christianity, Hinduism, Islam, Jews, and Mormonism.
\end{genericsection}

\begin{genericsection}{Neofundamentalist Ideologists}
\textbf{No universal leadership}\\
Born in the classical philosphical teachings of Earth (especially Stoicism). NFI adherants believe in accepting your lot in life, actively resisting temptation, and using Science to further our understanding of the world
\end{genericsection}

\begin{genericsection}{New Catholics}
\textbf{Ruling Council on Bergthora, Penthus}\\
Cut off from the Vatican (and Earth), the primarily Catholic colony at Bergthora created their own Council of Cardinals to provide leadership for their faithful. The Council gradually took over the governance of the entire system. New Catholics are the largest Christian organisation in the sector, mainly because they accept differing ideas on the nature of God and were able to adopt practices of other Christians
\end{genericsection}

\begin{genericsection}{Quietist Muslims}
\textbf{Communal Democracy}\\
Largely concentrated on Mahats in the Careeno system. After the turbulent 21st Century, the Islamic faith began to reject the old power structures and began to democratically guide their faith in the best interests of the community. The faith largely shuns foriegn policy issues that do not affect their world, and strives to limit their involvement with the affairs of nonbelievers. They prefer to keep to their own kind and avoid positions of wealth and power
\end{genericsection}

\begin{genericsection}{Stellarist Muslims}
\textbf{Communal Democracy}\\
Largely concentrated on Mahats in the Careeno system. A reaction to the Quietist movement, Stellarists believe that the movement has drifted too far from the original teachings. Stellarists desire to reintegrate the Islam faith within the larger interstellar community, and allow their members to actively seek positions of power and wealth
\end{genericsection}

\begin{genericsection}{Syncretism}
\textbf{No universal leadership}\\
After the Surge, many colonies began to focus on survival instead of religious fundamentals. This has resulted in many planets mixing and matching tenets from a wide spectrum of beliefs. This is the most common religion found within the sector
