\begin{powertable}{ p{.20\textwidth} p{.10\textwidth} p{.15\textwidth} p{.45\textwidth} }
  \textbf{Name} & \textbf{Leadership} & \textbf{Homeworld} & \textbf{Description}\\
  Neofundamentalist Ideologists &	No universal leadership & - & Born in the classical philosphical teachings of Earth (especially Stoicism). NFI adherants believe in accepting your lot in life, actively resisting temptation, and using Science to further our understanding of the world\\ 
  New Catholics & Council & Bergthora, Penthus & Cut off from the Vatican (and Earth), the primarily Catholic colony at Bergthora created their own Council of Cardinals to provide leadership for their flock. The Council gradually took over the government of the system. New Catholics are the largest Christian organisation, mainly because they accept differing ideas on the nature of God and were able to adopt practices of other Christians\\
  Quietist Muslims & Democracy & Mahats, Careeno & After the turbulent 21st Century, the Islamic faith began to reject the power structures of the Imams and the Mosques, and began to democratically guide the faith in the best interests of the community. The faith largely shuns the foriegn policy issues that do not affect their world, and strives to limit their involvement with the affairs of nonbelievers. They prefer to keep to their own kind and avoid positions of wealth and power\\
  Separatist Muslims & Democracy & Mahats, Careeno & Some of the Muslim faith believe that the Quietist movement have drifted too far from the original teachings. Seperatists desire to reintegrate the Islam faith within the larger interstellar community, and allow their members to actively seek positions of power and wealth\\
  Syncretism & No universal leadership & - & After the Surge, many colonies began to focus on survival instead of religious fundamentals. This has resulted in many planets mixing and matching tenets from a wide spectrum of beliefs. This is the most common religion found within the sector\\
