\subsection{Trade Map}

  This section is a brief and dirty overview of the trade situation in the Black. It loosely assigns trade goods that a sector is known to import and export, and adds tags that loosely describes an overall "aesthetic" of items produced in that sector. But be warned; the situation is always changing!
