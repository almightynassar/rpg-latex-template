\subsection{Downtime}

\subsubsection{Buying	a	Rare	Item}
Purchasing a rare and hard to find item requires at least \$100 and one workweek just to contact people willing to sell. You may be required to spend more time and money to find especially hard, rare or illegal items. After spending the resources, you make a Streetwise check to see if a seller has been found (you may have a bonus to this roll if you spend more money). A success means that you have found a lead, a failure means you were not able to find any sellers.

Note that putting the word out that you are buying something rare may attract thieves, con artists and other undesirables (because of the large sums of money involved in such a sale).

\subsubsection{Carousing}

This activity involves fine food, strong drink and socializing. You may choose to carouse with the general population, socialites (celebrities, politicians, the rich) or the underbelly (criminals and other undesirables). For the socialites and the underbelly you will need to be established as "one of them" or have an existing relationship before you are invited to join them (otherwise, make a Persuasion check to convince them to let you in).

For every day of carousing with the general population or underbelly you spend \$5 to cover expenses. For socialites you spend \$100 a day (they have expensive tastes). For every week you socialize you make a a Persuasion check and check the following table:

\begin{redtable}{\linewidth}{@{}L{1}@{}}
\textbf{1 or less}\\
You have made a hostile contact\\
\textbf{2-3}\\
No effect\\
\textbf{4-6}\\
You have made one allied contact\\
\textbf{7-9}\\
You have made two allied contacts\\
\textbf{10+}\\
You have made three allied contacts\\
\end{redtable}

Contacts are NPCs that share some sort of bond with the character. A hostile one will work against you, while an allied contact are friends that will help you within limits. Once a contact has helped or hindered the character, you will need to carouse again to keep in their good graces. A contact will not provide help for life, but will remain friendly.

The may be a complication. For each week of carousing, roll a d10. On a 3 or less, roll another d10 and consult the table:

\begin{redtable}{\linewidth}{@{}L{1}@{}}
\textbf{1 or less}\\
An additional 1d10 * \$10 is spent (either pick-pocketed, or used to impress people)\\
\textbf{2}\\
A fight broke out and you were somehow involved\\
\textbf{3}\\
You accidentally insulted someone important\\
\textbf{4}\\
You were banned from somewhere for some reason\\
\textbf{5}\\
You made a social gaffe that somehow made it onto the tabloids\\
\textbf{6}\\
An obnoxious person has taken an intense romantic interest in you\\
\textbf{7}\\
You have been recruited to participate in a local festival, event, or play\\
\textbf{8}\\
You made a promise to complete a quest for someone\\
\textbf{9}\\
You made a rival (this hostile contact is in additional to you normal social contact roll)\\
\textbf{10}\\
You have a fuzzy memory about doing something illegal, but you can't remember what\\
\end{redtable}

\subsubsection{Prize Fighting}

This covers boxing, wrestling, martial arts and other non-lethal forms of combat. You need at least a week to prepare for the fight, but you can spend more time for training (the week of the fight does not count). For every week of training you may make one skill roll, with each success giving you a +1 bonus on fight night (for a maximum of +4). You can only use a particular skill once during the whole training process. The skills you may use during training are: Athletics, Battle, Fighting, Insight, Intimidation, Notice, and Taunt.

On fight night, you will need to make three opposed checks: Athletics, Fighting and Notice. If you win the majority of the checks then you win the fight and the prize money. The prize money is usually \$50 for amateur bouts, \$100 for professionals, \$200 for ranked fights, and for championship or PPV fights the rewards are negotiable.

If you roll a 1 on any die during the fight or in training, you suffer an injury of some sort. Roll on the injury table to find out what it is.

\subsubsection{Relaxation}

You take a hard-earned vacation, or just need time to recover from injuries. It requires at least one week, and you need to be able to spend \$35 per week to cover expenses. While relaxing, you gain a +1 bonus to natural healing rolls.

\subsubsection{Work}

You can simply to choose to work in a trade in between adventures. You will still need to pay at least \$35 per week to cover expenses. You can only work 5 days in a week. To begin, choose a Skill that you are going to work in and make a roll to see if you are able to get a job.

\textbf{1 or less}\\
Unable to find a job. You are able to choose one of the other downtime options\\
\textbf{2-3}\\

\textbf{6-9}\\
You make \$20 a day as a senior member of the team\\
\textbf{10+}\\
You make \$30 a day as a specialist\\
\end{redtable}

You may have to roll every week you work to see if you are able to maintain your performance, which may earn you promotions or being fired.
