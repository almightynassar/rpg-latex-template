\section{Jobs \& Downtime}

\begin{multicols}{2}

  This section outlines how you can make (and spend) money in the Black. To determine whether a Job is profitable or not, you need to figure out your expenses (crew, FTL fuel, maintenance, bills, living expenses and equipment) and determine if the offered price makes the job worth it. Your expenses may include:
  
  \begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{FTL Fuel Costs}. Calculate the number of jumps required, and modify that number by your hull type to calculate the amount of fuel you will be using. Times this by \$1,000 to determine estimated fuel costs.
    \item \textbf{Job time}. Include time in FTL travel (roughly 6 days per hex) and traveling to different planets or places within an sector (roughly 48 hours). You will use this to estimate other costs.
    \item \textbf{Maintenance}. This covers everything from spacecraft to cyberware. Calculate roughly 0.5\% of your equipment's value per month. You may spread this cost over many different jobs
    \item \textbf{Crew wages}. Crew are generally paid (some may settle for other arrangements)
    \item \textbf{Extra Equipment}. Some Jobs may require equipment you do not have, so account for purchasing necessary equipment
    \item \textbf{Miscellaneous}, including food and amenities. As a rough guide, factor 5 credits per day per crew for a basic rations and amenities (such as soap, toilet paper, and other necessities). Spending more will mean better comfort and satisfaction
  \end{itemize}
  
\subsection{Employees}

  Employees can be hired using daily rates. The starting rate is \$5 a day for unskilled labour (assuming you are provided board and meals, otherwise add an additional \$5 on top). Skilled labour increases this cost by adding another \$5 for each d6 Skill, \$10 for each d8 Skill, and \$20 for each d10 Skill (only for the Skills you are hiring them for). Extremely skilled employees (those with Skills at d12 and above) are rarer and more expensive, and will negotiate their own rates. Employees bring their own basic tools but may require more sophisticated facilities to work efficiently.
  
  NPC Employees will not normally risk their lives or safety for their employer outside the line of immediate duty, and will demand double their wages for risky jobs. They may also be reluctant to go off-world unless they have established a trusting relationship with you.
  
  A brief list of possible Employee wages:
  
  \begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Mercenary} \textit{(Battle d6; Fighting d8; Shooting d8)}: \$30 per day
    \item \textbf{Navigator} \textit{(Astrogation d10; Operations d6)}: \$30 per day
    \item \textbf{Pilot} \textit{(Piloting d10; Operations d6)}: \$30 per day
    \item \textbf{Ship Doctor} \textit{(Healing d10; Medicine d8; Knowledge (Biology) d6)}: \$40 per day
    \item \textbf{Technician (Junior)} \textit{(Computers d6; Operations d6; Repair d6))}: \$20 per day
    \item \textbf{Technician (Senior)} \textit{(Computers d8; Operations d8; Repair d8))}: \$35 per day
    \item \textbf{Trader} \textit{(Bureaucracy d6; Business d8; Insight d6)}: \$25 per day
  \end{itemize}
