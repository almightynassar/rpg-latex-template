\section{Jobs}

\begin{multicols}{2}

  This section outlines how you can earn money from Jobs and other contracts and make money in the Black. We will only focus on jobs for Spacecraft and their crew since it is trivial to figure out profitable jobs for land-bound teams. Also, these rules are mainly for the GM so that they can offer suitable and satisfactory rewards for a Job well done.
  
  To determine whether a Job is profitable or not, we need to figure out your expenses (crew, FTL fuel, maintenance, and equipment) and determine if the offered price makes the job worth it. Your expenses include:
  
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Your FTL Fuel. Calculate the number of jumps required to complete the mission and times that value by 1000 (standard FTL fuel cost, adjusted by local market fluctuations)
    \item Estimated Job time. Don't include time in FTL travel (roughly 6 days per hex) and traveling to different planets in an area (roughly 48 hours) 
    \item Your Spacecraft Maintenance. This is 0.5\% of your spacecraft's value per month. If the Job is estimated to go several months then increase this value accordingly
    \item Crew wages. Crew are generally paid a daily wage (some may settle for other arrangements). Some crew demand that they get paid double for risky jobs, and for outright dangerous jobs can demand even more.
    \item Extra Equipment. You most likely will not be fitted out for every job that falls onto your lap, so account for purchasing necessary equipment
    \item Miscellanous, including food and amenities. As a rough guide, factor 5 credits per day per crew for a basic rations and amenities (such as soap, toilet paper, and other necessities). Spending more will mean better comfort and satisfaction for your crew
  \end{itemize}
  
  \subsection{Employees}

  Employees can be hired at the given daily rates. Each column denotes the skill level of the employee, with higher skilled employees being rarer and more expensive to find. Employees bring their own basic tools but may require more sophisticated facilities to work efficiently.
  
  NPC Employees will not normally risk their lives or safety for their employer outside the line of immediate duty, and will demand double their wages for risky jobs. They may also be reluctant to go off-world unless they have established a trusting relationship with you.
