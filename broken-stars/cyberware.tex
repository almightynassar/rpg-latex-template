\section{Cyberware}
\label{sec:cyberware}

\begin{multicols}{2}

Cyberware is where metal meets flesh, electronics meets neurons, and the digital meets the analog. Cyberware are extremely complex to make and install, and requires a skilled team of engineers and surgeons to perform the implant procedure. Every single cyberware installation requires at least a cortical stack so that the cyberware can interface with the brain (Cortical stacks are usually provided free of charge during installation). The Cortical stack contains a Muse program, which is a simple AI that helps control all of your new implants. Your Muse is generally voice activated, although some skilled cyberware users are known to be able to control their Muse voicelessly.

Bots and Shells can still enjoy the benefits of Cyberware, but suffer the same limitations as organics (because Cyberware is mass manufactured to meet organic demand). Your cyberware will still be voice activated, you will interface with a Muse program to use your cyberware, and you will need a team of skilled engineers to design and install the machine-cyberware interface.

There are three types of cyberware:

\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Augmented Reality} or AR cyberware deals with systems that overlay information onto your other senses. Every AR package comes with voice activated Muse software that helps you control your AR experience.
  \item \textbf{Basic} cyberware includes all types of prosthetic parts from legs to eyes. With advances in material technology, these prosthetics do not weigh heavier than organic body parts (and if desired can be overlayed with synthetic skin). They still require a cortical stack to operate normally.
  \item \textbf{Enhanced} cyberware are complex yet powerful devices that can give you an edge. They generally rewrite your whole body mechanics, and usually require extensive preparation and testing before installation (including the removal of body-parts and organs). Because of this, you will need to take an Edge before you can use Enhanced cyberware. Taking more Cyberware Edges will increase your cyberware limit. If your cyberware limit is high enough, you are considered more machine than man. 
\end{itemize}

\subsection{AR}

\textbf{AR cyberware} is only used to overlay information over your natural senses. There are three flavours: 
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textit{Simple} AR deals only with audio information and works like a radio, allowing your Muse and others to talk to you remotely
  \item \textit{Advanced} AR handles both audio and visual and can provide a basic Heads-Up Display (HUD) over what you see, or project visual images instead of what you see
  \item \textit{Deluxe} interfaces with all of your senses (it can also record these sensations for later playback, although it can only store a few memories locally before it needs to be backed-up externally). Some Deluxe cyberware owners like to use Sim-Sense, where they can fully immerse themselves into a digital world, or a recording of someone else's memories
\end{itemize}

No AR cyberware can enhanced your senses; you cannot zoom in on a target, hear distant sounds or improve your sense of smell.

\begin{standardtable}{\linewidth}{bss}
  \textbf{Type} & \textbf{Toughness} & \textbf{Price}\\
  AR Simple & - & 250\\
  AR Advanced & - & 500\\
  AR Deluxe & - & 1000\\
\end{standardtable}

\subsection{Basic}

\textbf{Basic replacement} cyberware have no special functionality and do not grant any bonuses to the wearer. This cyberware does not have any negative side effects either. The only difference is that they have their own toughness rating and will be destroyed if they receive too much damage. If you receive a wound on a cybernetic limb the limb is disabled. You do not gain a wound but suffer the consequences of a missing body-part. The pieces can be repaired with a successful Repair roll.

No Basic cyberware can enhanced your senses; you cannot zoom in on a target, hear distant sounds or improve your sense of smell.

\begin{standardtable}{\linewidth}{bss}
  \textbf{Type} & \textbf{Toughness} & \textbf{Price}\\
  Cyberarm & 10 & 750\\
  Cyberear & 5 & 250\\
  Cybereye & 5 & 500\\
  Cyberleg & 10 & 500\\
  Cyberorgan & 5 & 1500\\
\end{standardtable}

\subsection{Enhanced}

This type of cyberware requires you to undergo a lengthy and involved process, which will include the removal of body parts and organs. You will effectively be considered a Cyborg after the process is complete. You will usually undergo a treatment of drugs (to prepare the body for the upcoming cyberware changes), a psychological assessment (to ensure you are mentally prepared), and other preparatory work. It also includes a significant financial investment (although up to 1000 of this cost is waived for starting characters).

To be able to use any Enhanced Cyberware, you are required to have the \textit{Cyberware Install} edge to increase your cyberware limit to 1. This allows you to install one piece of Cyberware that has 10 power charges. Installing additional cyberware parts require that you purchase the \textit{Cyberware (New)} edge, which will increase your cyberware limit by 1. You can change your cyberware installations at anytime, provided you purchase the new cyberware (old cyberware can be sold at half your purchasing price).

Cyberware can be incredibly powerful, but it is can also be dangerous. When you activate cyberware, make the requisite Skill roll to see if you successfully activated it's effects. Activation is a free and immediate action.

A failure means that nothing happens but the power charges are spent. On a success, you spend the charges and gain the effects of the cyberware.  Some devices use up more charges to maintain it's effect; this is denoted by the Duration column (i.e \textbf{3(2/round)} tells us that the power originally lasts 3 rounds, and by spending two charges we can continue it's effects for 1 more round). Cyberware regain their power charge naturally, at a rate of 1 charge per hour.

When you roll a 1 on the skill die used to activate your cyberware, it has malfunctioned in some way and will not work. Roll a d4 and consult the table:

\begin{standardtable}{\linewidth}{sb}
  \textbf{Roll} & \textbf{Result}\\
  1 & The cyberware breaks down, and you may not use it again until it is repaired, which requires a repair roll and 2d6 hours of work\\
  2 & The cyberware suffers a minor hiccup, and can be fixed immediately with a Repair roll that has a -d4 penalty\\
  3 & The cyberware activates but does the opposite of what is intended\\
  4 & The cyberware just misfired, and should work fine next turn\\
\end{standardtable}

\textbf{Charges:} 4\\
\textbf{Range:} Self\\
\textbf{Duration:} 1 hour (2/hour)\\
Your muscles, bones, and vocal cords in your face and throat have been replaced with a morphable, synthetic substance. This allows you to alter your facial features with a thought. Each change takes five minutes (including reverting to your normal face). You can alter your Charisma by 1 point per success and raise. The implant may be used to duplicate a specific person’s face and speech (assuming they’re of the same relative size and species) if a picture (and voice sample for the vocal cords) exists.

\textbf{Cost:} \$1500\\
\textbf{Skill:} Spirit\\
\textbf{Charges:} 2\\
\textbf{Range:} Self\\
\textbf{Duration:} 3 rounds (1/round)\\
Your adrenal gland has been surgically augmented. You have a +2 bonus to recover from being Shaken while the implant is activated. This stacks
with other Edges and bonuses.

\textbf{Skill:} Vigor\\
\textbf{Charges:} 1\\
\textbf{Range:} Self\\
\textbf{Duration:} 1 hour (1/hour)\\
Your body has been altered so that you can stay alive in vacuum (and even underwater). When activated, you can use an internal oxygen supply (additional oxygen is made by converting biomass, which uses additional charges). Your feet have magnetic seals that allow you to walk on metal surfaces. The sheathing closes off all entry and exit points so that your body does not explode due to pressure differences (your vocal cords are diverted to transmit itself over radio, and your excrement are stored for later evacuation)
\end{genericsection}

\begin{genericsection}{Revenant Wiring}
\textbf{Cost:} \$15000\\
\textbf{Skill:} Vigor\\
\textbf{Charges:} 1\\
