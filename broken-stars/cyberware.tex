\section{Cyberware}

\begin{multicols}{2}

Cyberware is where metal meets flesh. Cyberware are extremely complex, and require skilled teams of engineers and surgeons to perform the implant procedure. Every single cyberware installation requires at least a cortical stack so that the machines can interface with the brain (Cortical stacks are usually provided free of charge during installation). The Cortical stack contains a Muse program, which is a simple AI that helps control all of your new implants. Your Muse is voice activated, although some skilled cyberware users are known to be able to control their Muse voicelessly.

There are three types of cyberware:

\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Augemented Reality} or AR cyberware deals with systems that overlay information onto your other senses. Every AR package comes with voice activated Muse software that helps you control your AR experience.
  \item \textbf{Basic} cyberware includes all types of prosthetic parts from legs to eyes. They still require a cortical stack to operate normally.
  \item \textbf{Enhanced} cyberware are complex yet powerful devices that can give you an edge over others. They generally rewrite your whole body mechanics, and usually require extensive preparation and testing before installation.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{AR}

\textbf{AR cyberware} is only used to overlay information over your natural senses. There are three flavours: 
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textit{Simple} AR deals only with audio information and works like a radio, allowing your Muse and others to talk to you remotely
  \item \textit{Advanced} AR handles both audio and visual and can provide a basic Heads-Up Display (HUD) over what you see, or project visual images instead of what you see
  \item \textit{Deluxe} interfaces with all of your senses (it can also record these sensations for later playback, although it can only store a few memories locally before it needs to be backed-up externally). Some Deluxe cyberware owners like to use Sim-Sense, where they can fully immerse themselves into a digital world, or a recording of someone elses memories. It can also store 1 computer program (see Gear - Equipment list for more information)
\end{itemize}

No AR cyberware can enhanced your senses; you cannot zoom in on a target, hear distant sounds or improve your sense of smell.

  AR Simple & - & 250\\
  AR Advanced & - & 750\\
  AR Deluxe & - & 3000\\
\end{standardtable}

\subsection{Basic}

\textbf{Basic replacement} cyberware have no special functionality and do not grant any bonuses to the wearer. This cyberware does not have any negative side effects either. The only difference is that they have their own toughness rating and will be destroyed if they receive too much damage. If you receive a wound on a cybernetic limb the limb is disabled. You do not gain a wound but suffer the consequences of a missing bodypart. The pieces can be repaired with a successful Repair roll.

No Basic cyberware can enhanced your senses; you cannot zoom in on a target, hear distant sounds or improve your sense of smell.

  \textbf{Type} & \textbf{Toughness} & \textbf{Price}\\

  Cyberleg & 10 & 500\\

\end{standardtable}

\subsection{Enhanced}

This type of cyberware requires you to undergo a lengthy and involved process. This process varies from installation, but usually involves taking a treatment of drugs (to prepare the body for the upcoming cyberware changes), a psychological assessment (to ensure you are mentally prepared), and other preparatory work. It also includes a significant financial investment (although this cost is waived for starting characters).

To be able to use any Enhanced Cyberware, you are required to have the \textit{Cyberware Install} edge. This allows you to install one piece of Cyberware that has 10 power charges. Installing new cyberware parts require that you purchase the \textit{Cyberware (New)} edge, which will give you a new cyberware with it's own 10 power charges.

Cyberware can be incredibly powerful, but it is can also be dangerous. When you activate cyberware, make a Skill roll to see if you successfully activated it's effects. A failure means that nothing happens but the power charges are spent. On a success, you spend the charges and gain the effects of the cyberware.  Some devices use up more charges to maintain it's effect; this is denoted by the Duration column (i.e 3(2/round) tells us that the power originally lasts 3 rounds, and by spending two charges we can continue it's effects for 1 more round). Cyberware regain their power charges naturally, at a rate of 1 charge per hour.

When you roll a 1 on the skill die used to activate your cyberware, it has malfunctioned in some way an will not work. Roll a d4 and consult the table:

\begin{standardtable}{\linewidth}{sb}
  \textbf{Roll} & \textbf{Result}\\
  1 & The cyberware breaks down, and you may not use it again until it is repaired, which requires a repair roll and 2d6 hours of work\\
  2 & The cyberware suffers a minor hiccup, and can be fixed immediately with a Repair roll at -d4\\
  3 & The cyberware activates but does the opposite of what is intended\\
  4 & The cyberware just misfired, and should work fine next turn\\
