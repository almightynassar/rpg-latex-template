\section{Gear}
\label{sec:gear}

\begin{multicols}{2}

The Black has a wealth of gear available for adventuring crews to purchase. A saavy crew-member would be able to play the interstellar market to buy low and sell high. And there is always the opportunity to visit low-tech worlds and sell the latest weaponry to the highest bidder...

\subsection{Rules \& Definitions}
\label{sec:gear-rules}

\begin{genericsection}{Armour}
Armour rating for gear is added to your character's Toughness when the covered location is hit. You only benefit from the armour with the highest armour rating (i.e. armour do not stack). Attacks are always directed at the torso unless otherwise stated.
\end{genericsection}

\begin{genericsection}{Armour Piercing (AP)}
An AP rating means the weapon ignores that many points of armour. Excess AP is simply lost.
\end{genericsection}

\begin{genericsection}{Bipod}
Machine guns and sniper rifles benefit from the use of a bipod. It takes one action to deploy a bipod, and once deployed it reduces the autofire penalty to -1. If you move, you negate this benefit and will need to reset the bipod.
\end{genericsection}

\begin{genericsection}{Computers}
Computers are embedded into nearly every device out in the Black. Computer Grades are a nice handy way of catergorizing the numerous devices you will likely encounter. Each Grade provides the services of the previous grade.

\input{broken-stars/tables/computer-grades}
\end{genericsection}

\begin{genericsection}{Cost}
The base value for everything in the Black comes down to Credits (represented by the \$ symbol). All values shown here are for a Tech-Level 4 (TL4) planet. When shopping at a market with a different Tech-Level, apply the following rules (Trade Goods are handled differently):
\begin{itemize}
  \item For lower Tech Levels, double the price for each difference in level. For example, selling something worth \$100 on a Stone Age planet (TL0) is a difference of 4. Doubling the price three times gives us an approximate sale price of \$1600.

  \item For higher Tech Levels than the gear itself, take 25\% for each difference in level (rounded down). For instance, selling something worth \$100 on a Pre-Surge planet (TL6) is a difference of 2. Taking 25\% off each time gives us an approximate sale price of \$56.
\end{itemize}
\end{genericsection}

\begin{genericsection}{Heavy Weapon (HW)}
A weapon designated with HW can affect vehicles and other equipment with Heavy Armour.
\end{genericsection}

\begin{genericsection}{High Explosive (HE)}
A weapon designated with HE will use a burst template and follows the rules for Area Effect attacks (\textit{\hyperref[sec:rules-combat]{see Combat Rules}}).
\end{genericsection}

\begin{genericsection}{Minimum Strength (MS)}
Using gear without meeting it's MS rating will incur a few penalties. A melee weapon's damage die is downgraded to your Strength die, and you do not gain any of the weapon's bonuses (but you do incur their penalties). Ranged weapons incur a -1 penalty to each attack roll for every step of difference between their Strength and the MS rating (it is ignored if the weapon is braced on a support or bipod).
\end{genericsection}

\begin{genericsection}{Missiles}
To fire a missile, you are required to gain a lock (an opposed roll, with range modifiers). At short range, target has 1 round to evade, 2 at medium, and 3 at long.
\end{genericsection}

\begin{genericsection}{Power Armour}
Power Armour support their own weight so are not included as part of encumberance. Light suits weigh about 50 kg, Medium Suits weigh 75 kg, and Heavy suits weigh 110 kg. All power suits have a 2.5 km communications unit built in. Power Armour lasts 1 week on a single charge, and requires 10 hours charging at a special facility to return to full power
\end{genericsection}

\begin{genericsection}{Programs}
\label{sec:gear-programs}
Running a program uses up a computer's (or cortical stack's) portable power reserves. A computer will come with a number of "Charges" related to it's Grade. A program's level indicates the number of "Charges" it uses when executed (Basic Grade computer devices cannot run programs).
\end{genericsection}

\begin{genericsection}{Rate of Fire (RoF)}
The maximum number of shots that may be taken by this weapon per action. No rule can allow you to exceed the RoF
\end{genericsection}

\begin{genericsection}{Scope}
+2 to Shooting at Medium or longer distances as long as you do not move
\end{genericsection}

\begin{genericsection}{Snapfire}
Gear with the snapfire property are inaccurate when shot from the hip. If you move at any time during the round, you take a -2 penalty
\end{genericsection}

\begin{genericsection}{Tech-Levels}
Tech-Levels (TL) are the standard way to catergorise the different technological capabilities of a planet. 

Please refer to the \textit{\hyperref[sec:sector-tech-levels]{Sector Tech Levels section}}

\subsection{Weapons}

\subsubsection{Slug Guns}

These weapons are so named because they fire a projectile (either a pellet, bullet or slug) towards it's target and deals kinetic damage. These weapons are relatively simple to build and make, so can be found on most planets with some manufacturing capabilities. By far the most popular weapon-type of choice in the Black.
