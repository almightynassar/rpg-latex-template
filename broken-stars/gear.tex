\subsection{Tech-Levels}
\label{sec:gear-tech}
  
Tech-Levels (TL) are a standard way to catergorise the differing manufacturing capabilities of a planet. To get more information please refer to the \textit{\hyperref[sec:sector-tech-levels]{Sector Tech Levels section}}

When selling or buying gear on a planet that is of a lower Tech Level than the gear itself, double the price for each difference in level. For example, selling Basic Weave (TL: 4, \$100) on a Stone Age planet (TL: 0) is a difference of 4. Doubling the price three times gives us an approximate sale price of \$1600 Credits.

When selling or buying gear on a planet that is of a higher Tech Level than the gear itself, halve price for each difference in level. For instance, selling a Revolver (TL:2, \$300) on a Interstellar planet (TL: 4) is a difference of 2. Halving the price two times gives us an approximate sale price of \$75.

\subsection{Computers}
\label{sec:gear-computers}

Computers are the life-blood of the Black (at least those with the Tech to make them). You can embed them into nearly anything, and they run almost everything. Computer Grades are a nice handy way of catergorizing the numerous devices you will likely encounter.

Each Grade provides the services of the previous grade (A Cortical Stack will at least provide a Basic service).

\begin{itemize}
  \item Basic: Data Storage, Gaming, Communication, Translation at d6, Credit Storage, Identification
  \item Grade I: +1 modifier on common knowledge rolls while connected to a planetwide network
  \item Grade II: Can store up to 1 level of programs.
  \item Grade III: Can store up to 2 levels of programs
  \item Grade IV:  Can store up to 4 levels of programs
  \item Grade V: Can store up to 5 levels of programs
\end{itemize}

A computer is primarily used to run programs. Running a program uses up a computer's portable power reserves, and like most cyberware a computer will come with 10 "Charges". A program's level indicates the number of "Charges" it uses when executed (Basic and Grade I computer services do not consume a "Charge").

\begin{itemize}
  \item Level 1 programs counts as d4 in a skill
  \item Level 2 programs counts as d6 in a skill and can roll cooperatively with users that have the same skill at d8 minimum
  \item Level 3 programs counts as d8 in a skill and can roll cooperatively with users that have the same skill at d8 minimum
\end{itemize}
