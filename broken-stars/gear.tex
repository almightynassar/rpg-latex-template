\section{Gear}
\label{sec:gear}

\begin{multicols}{2}

\subsection{Rules \& Definitions}
\label{sec:gear-rules}

\begin{genericsection}{Armour}
Armour rating for gear is added to your character's Toughness when the covered location is hit. You only benefit from the armour with the highest armour rating (i.e. armour do not stack). Attacks are always directed at the torso unless otherwise stated.
\end{genericsection}

\begin{genericsection}{Armour Piercing (AP)}
An AP rating means the weapon ignores that many points of armour. Excess AP is simply lost.
\end{genericsection}

\begin{genericsection}{Bipod}
Machine guns and sniper rifles benefit from the use of a bipod. It takes one action to deploy a bipod, and once deployed it reduces the auto-fire penalty to -1. If you move, you negate this benefit and will need to reset the bipod.
\end{genericsection}

\begin{genericsection}{Computers}
Computers are embedded into nearly every device out in the Black. They provide Storage, Communication (can receive and transmit signals in a 2.5 km radius), Identification, and gives a +1 modifier on when spending an action to perform any sort of knowledge roll.
\end{genericsection}

\begin{genericsection}{Cost}
The base value for everything in the Black comes down to Credits (represented by the \$ symbol). All values shown here are for a Tech-Level 4 (TL4) planet. When shopping at a market with a different Tech-Level, apply the following rules (Trade Goods are handled differently):
\begin{itemize}
  \item For lower Tech Levels, double the price for each difference in level. For example, selling something worth \$100 on a Stone Age planet (TL0) is a difference of 4. Doubling the price four times gives us an approximate sale price of \$1600.

  \item For higher Tech Levels than the gear itself, take off 25\% for each difference in level (rounded down). For instance, selling something worth \$100 on a Pre-Surge planet (TL6) is a difference of 2. Taking 25\% off each time gives us an approximate sale price of \$56.
\end{itemize}
\end{genericsection}

\begin{genericsection}{Heavy Weapon (HW)}
A weapon designated with HW can affect vehicles and other equipment with Heavy Armour.
\end{genericsection}

\begin{genericsection}{High Explosive (HE)}
A weapon designated with HE will use a burst template and follows the rules for Area Effect attacks (\textit{\hyperref[sec:rules-combat]{see Combat Rules}}).
\end{genericsection}

\begin{genericsection}{Minimum Strength (MS)}
Using gear without meeting it's MS rating will incur a few penalties. A melee weapon's damage die is downgraded to your Strength die, and you do not gain any of the weapon's bonuses (but you do incur their penalties). Ranged weapons incur a -1 penalty to each attack roll for every step of difference between their Strength and the MS rating (it is ignored if the weapon is braced on a support or bipod).
\end{genericsection}

\begin{genericsection}{Missiles}
To fire a missile, you are required to gain a lock (an opposed roll, with range modifiers). At short range, target has 1 round to evade, 2 at medium, and 3 at long.
\end{genericsection}

\begin{genericsection}{Power Armour}
Power Armour support their own weight so are not included as part of encumbrance. Light suits weigh about 50 kg, Medium Suits weigh 75 kg, and Heavy suits weigh 110 kg. All power suits have a 2.5 km communications unit built in. Power Armour lasts 1 week on a single charge, and requires 10 hours charging at a special facility to return to full power
\end{genericsection}

\begin{genericsection}{Rate of Fire (RoF)}
The maximum number of shots that may be taken by this weapon per action. No rule can allow you to exceed the RoF
\end{genericsection}

\begin{genericsection}{Scope}
+2 to Shooting at Medium or longer distances as long as you do not move
\end{genericsection}

\begin{genericsection}{Snapfire}
Gear with the snapfire property are inaccurate when shot from the hip. If you move at any time during the round, you take a -2 penalty
\end{genericsection}

\begin{genericsection}{Tech-Levels}
Tech-Levels (TL) are the standard way to categorize the different technological capabilities of a planet. 

Please refer to the \textit{\hyperref[sec:sector-tech-levels]{Sector Tech Levels section}}
\end{genericsection}

\end{multicols}

\subsection{Armour}

\begin{multicols}{2}

\begin{genericsection}{ArmourWeave\texttrademark}
A modern cheap synthetic plastic that also can absorb damage from both kinetic and energy attacks.
\end{genericsection}

\begin{genericsection}{Chain}
Ancient method of linking chains of metal to protect against kinetic damage.
\end{genericsection}

\begin{genericsection}{Force Field}
Pre-Surge Tech that has not yet been reverse engineered. Belt-worn device that when activated provides an active barrier that deflects an destroys incoming attacks. It can be used continuously for 24 hours, after which it will require a one hour charge. Force fields stack with other types of armour except other force fields.
\end{genericsection}

\begin{genericsection}{Kevlar}
Out-dated synthetic plastic that is designed to protect against kinetic weapons such as bullets, slugs and bladed weapons.
\end{genericsection}

\begin{genericsection}{Kevlar+\texttrademark}
An improved version Kevlar that is significantly lighter and more malleable. It can also absorb damage from energy attacks.
\end{genericsection}

\begin{genericsection}{Plate}
Ancient method of shaping metal to protect against kinetic damage.
\end{genericsection}

\begin{genericsection}{Plasflect\texttrademark }
A lightweight, shiny, synthetic plastic designed to reflect energy damage away from the user. Can be worn over other pieces of armour (it still does not stack, but can allow user to mitigate different types of damage). Because it is shiny, wearing Plasflect incurs a -2 penalty to vision based stealth rolls.

If the user takes any sort of damage, roll a die per wound. An odd roll means that the plastic is damaged and can no longer offer protection.
\end{genericsection}

\begin{genericsection}{Space Suit}
This suit can keep you alive for d6+1 days in space. Includes an oxygen and refuse recycling system and positional adjustment jets. Due to its great resilience it can even be used under water.
\end{genericsection}

\end{rpgtable}

\subsection{Guns}

\begin{multicols}{2}

\begin{genericsection}{EMP}
EMP (Electro-Magnetic Pulse) weapons are designed to disable electronics with little to no damage so that they can be re-used. Affected electronics includes Bots, Cyberware, Spacecraft systems and Shells. They charge up and release a burst of EMP energy in a cone that reaches out for 9 squares, and is 3 squares at it's widest. Everything caught inside the cone takes the listed damage. Bots, Cyberware and Shells take normal damage (ignoring armour). Everyone else suffers half damage as their neural system is overloaded (including armour). Use cover rules as normal.
\end{genericsection}

\begin{genericsection}{Gauss}
Military-grade weapon that accelerates pieces of material (bullets and slugs) using electromagnetic coils to deliver kinetic damage. Also known as a Coilgun or Mag Gun.
\end{genericsection}

\begin{genericsection}{Magazine}
Every weapon is supplied with ammunition via a "Magazine". A Magazine contains the necessary ammunition for the weapon whether it uses slugs, plasma or energy. The table provides the cost and weight of a single magazine which provides the exact number of shots listed in the table.
\end{genericsection}

\begin{genericsection}{Plasma}
Military-grade weapon that super-heats a hydrogen pellet until it reaches it's plasma state, and then accelerates the plasma to it's target by magnetic coils. The plasma pellet dissipates relatively quickly, but causes a lot of energy damage. Targets also have a chance of catching on fire.
\end{genericsection}

\begin{genericsection}{Slug}
These weapons are so named because they fire a projectile (either a pellet, bullet or slug) towards it's target and deals kinetic damage. These weapons are relatively simple to build and make, so can be found on most planets with some manufacturing capabilities. By far the most popular weapon-type of choice in the Black.
\end{genericsection}

\begin{genericsection}{TDD}
These Exotic weapons use TDD technology to bend space-time around the target. There are no projectiles or beams involved. Spending a round calibrating the weapon onto it's target means the weapon can ignore cover (and even "shoot" through walls). These weapons and it's ammunition are rare if they are produced at all\\
When a target is hit, it suffers the listed damage. If it causes a wound, roll a hit location using the Injury Chart and allow the user to make a Vigor roll. A raise causes no additional result, but success means the limb is crippled until the wound is healed. Failure means the limb is completely disintegrated. Failed rolls to the head or torso cause death. If the target was inorganic matter, the attack disintegrates a 12 inch diameter, 4 inch thick disc of matter per attack.

\end{rpgtable}

\subsection{Misc. Weapons}

\begin{multicols}{2}

\begin{genericsection}{Baton}
\textbf{TL: 1, \$25, .5kg}
A simple bludgeoning stick that deals Str+d4 damage
\end{genericsection}

\begin{genericsection}{Bow}
\textbf{TL: 1, \$50, 2kg}
A bow fires an arrow projectile at it's target using an archaic firing mechanism. The standard arrow has a cost of \$0.5 each. It also requires a minimum Strength of d8 to use.(NOTE: Arrows with different types of heads are available, such as explosive bolts. Use Grenades as a rough guide to what these bolts should cost and their effects).\\
\textbf{Range:} 15/30/60\\
\textbf{Damage:} 2d6
\end{genericsection}

\begin{genericsection}{Crossbow}
\textbf{TL: 1, \$100, 5kg}
A crossbow fires an arrow projectile at it's target using an archaic firing mechanism. When using a cross bow, it takes a full action to reload that cannot be sped up, and can only fire one bolt at a time (the standard bolt has an AP of 2, at a cost of \$0.5 each). It also requires a minimum Strength of d6 to use.(NOTE: Bolts with different types of heads are available, such as explosive bolts. Use Grenades as a rough guide to what these bolts should cost and their effects).\\
\textbf{Range:} 15/30/60\\
\textbf{Damage:} 2d6
\end{genericsection}

\begin{genericsection}{Molecular Blade}
\textbf{TL: 4, +\$500}
Swords and other edged weapons can be given a mono-filament, “molecular,” or extremely thin edge, making them far sharper than usual. This gives the weapon an extra +2 damage and adds half its damage die type in AP (+2 AP for a d4, +4 AP for a d8, +5 for a d10). Add the Molecular blade template over the Sword template.
\end{genericsection}

\begin{genericsection}{Sword}
\textbf{TL: 1, \$50, 4kg}
While there are many types and varieties of swords available, most of them are functionally the same. They have a cutting edge that is used to inflict damage on an opponent. Use the sword as a template for other archaic melee weapons such as axes and polearms (add additional reach as required). If using a 2-handed version of the weapon, the weapon has an AP of 1 at the cost of -1 Parry.\\
\textbf{Damage:} Strength +d8 (+d10 if 2-handed, +d4 if knife)
\end{genericsection}

\end{multicols}
