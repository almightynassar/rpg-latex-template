\subsection{Tech-Levels}
  
Tech-Levels are a standard way to catergorise the differing manufacturing capabilities of a planet. See the \textit{Tech Levels} section under the \textbf{Sector Shangra Omega} chapter for more information.

When selling or buying gear on a planet that is of a lower Tech Level than the gear itself, double the cost price for each level under gear level.

When selling or buying gear on a planet that is of a higher Tech Level than the gear itself, halve the cost price for each \textbf{TWO} level above the gear level.

  \item Grade V: In addition can store up to 5 levels of programs
\end{itemize}

\textbf{* Program Grades}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Grade 1 counts as d4 in a skill
  \item Grade 2 counts as d6 in a skill and can roll cooperatively with users that have the same skill at d8 max
  \item Grade 3 counts as d8 in a skill and can roll cooperatively with users that have the same skill at d8 minimum
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Employees}

Employees can be hired at the given rate. Those with d6 skill in the appropriate skill cost the smallest sum, while those d8 skill cost more and the rare d10 skill experts cost most of all. Employees bring their own basic tools but may require more sophisticated facilities to be provided. Employees will not normally risk their lives or safety for their employer outside the line of immediate duty. Employees will not normally travel off world with the characters.
