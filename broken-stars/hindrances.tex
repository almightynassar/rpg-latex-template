\section{Hindrances}

\textbf{Note:} Because Cyberware replacements are available, some Hindrances (like \textit{Blind}, \textit{Hard of Hearing}, \textit{One Arm}, \textit{One Eye}, and \textit{One Leg}) should not be available during character creation unless you take \textit{Cyberware Intolerance} to make the disability permanent. These disabilities remain on this list in case your character suffers an unfortunate injury.
