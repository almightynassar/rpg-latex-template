\section{Hindrances}

Hindrances are traits that affect your character negatively during the game. Some will affect your rolls, while others will affect the way you role-play. You are encouraged to come up with backstory for each hindrance; feel free to rename a hindrance to better suit your character concept.

When your character "levels up" by earning an advance, you can use that advance to "buy off" or remove one hindrance. A hindrance cannot be removed in any other way. For example, if you choose the \textit{Blind} hindrance then you cannot purchase cyber-eyes to remove the hindrance. Instead, your cyber-eyes malfunction in a way to satisfy the \textit{Blind} condition (you can flavour it to be that your blindness has something to do with your brain).
