    \begin{standardtable}{\linewidth}{sb}
      \textbf{Species} & \textbf{Description}\\
      Ay-Matak & Avian alien species that love to travel and experience life.\\
      Bots & Ranges from androids, robots, Ghosts, and everything in between.\\

    \end{standardtable}

  \item \textbf{Attributes}: You start with a d4 in each attribute and have 5 points with which to raise them. Raising an attribute by one die type costs 1 point (but you cannot raise an attribute above a d12).
    \begin{standardtable}{\linewidth}{sb}
      \textbf{Attribute} & \textbf{Description}\\
      Strength & Raw physical power and general fitness.\\
      Agility & Nimbleness, quickness and dexterity.\\
      Smarts & Mental agility and your knowledge about the worlds that inhabit the Black.\\
      Spirit & Inner wisdom and willpower.\\
      Vigor & Endurance and a measure of how much pain and physical damage you can shake off.\\
    \end{standardtable}

  \item \textbf{Skills}: You have 15 points for skills. Each die type in a skill costs 1 point up to the linked attribute. Going over the linked attribute costs 2 points per level. A seperate list of skills is provided in it's own section.

  \item \textbf{Derived Traits}: Calculate your derived traits according using your attributes and skills.
    \begin{standardtable}{\linewidth}{sb}
      \textbf{Trait} & \textbf{Description}\\
      Charisma & Calculated as: \textbf{(Spirit / 2) - 4}. General likeability and manners, and is added to all persuasion and streetwise rolls.\\
      Pace & Calculated as: \textbf{(Strength / 2) + 2}. How many squares of movement you can take during your turn.\\
      Parry & Calculated as: \textbf{(Fighting / 2) + 2}. Target number for melee combat or against ranged weapons within melee range.\\
      Toughness & Calculated as: \textbf{(Vigor / 2) + 2}. Add armour on top of toughness.\\
    \end{standardtable}

  \item \textbf{Hindrances}: You can choose to gain additional character creation points by taking up to \textbf{one} Major Hindrace (2 points) and up to \textbf{two} Minor Hindrances (1 point each).
    \begin{itemize}
        \item For 2 points you can gain another attribute point or choose an \textbf{Edge}.
        \item For 1 point you can gain another skill point or increase starting funds by 100\%.
    \end{itemize}

  \item \textbf{Edges}: Edges are what sets your character apart from everyone else. There are 3 main paths to choose from:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Standard}: Just use the normal Edge list.
        \item \textbf{Psionic}: Take the \textit{Psionic Background} edge and manipulate Space-Time. (\textit{Organics only})
        \item \textbf{Cyberware}: Take the \textit{Cyberware Install} edge and meld flesh with machine.
    \end{itemize}

  \item \textbf{Gear}: All characters start with 750 Credits to buy their equipment with.

  \item \textbf{Background Detail}: Fill in any other details of your character's background.
  
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Advancement}

Experience points are gained by completing a game session (of around 4-6 hours of gaming). Each game session is worth around 1-3 points. Unlike other role-playing games, instead of levels your character has a "\textbf{Rank}". Characters that have earned a higher rank are able to access the better Edges.

\begin{standardtable}{\linewidth}{sb}
    \textbf{XP} & \textbf{Rank}\\
    0-19 & Novice\\
    20-39 & Seasoned\\
    40-59 & Veteran\\
    60-79 & Heroic\\
    80+ & Legendary\\
  \end{standardtable}

Every 5 points accumulated grants the character an Advance (or 4 Advances per Rank). One Advance allows you to do the following:

\begin{itemize}
  \item Gain a new Edge
  \item Increase one skill that is equal to or greater than its linked attribute
  \item Increase two skills that are lower than its linked attribute
  \item Buy a new skill at d4
  \item Increase one attribute (only choose this once per Rank, and no Trait can be raised above a d12)
\end{itemize}
