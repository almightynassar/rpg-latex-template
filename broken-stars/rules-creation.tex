\subsection{Character Creation}
\label{sec:rules-creation}

\begin{enumerate}

  \item \textbf{Species:}\\ The main species of this sector is human, although you can choose to play one of the many alien species. The following is a list of the main alien species found in the sector, but there are other unique alien species scattered throughout (please talk to your Game Master to approve your unique idea).
  
  \hline
  
  \textbf{Ay-Matak:} Avian, bird-like alien species that love to travel and experience life. \textit{\hyperref[sec:specie-ay-matak]{See Species section Ay-Matak}}
  \begin{redtable}{\linewidth}{@{}L{1}@{}}
    \textbf{Flight}\\
    Can fly at their basic Pace and even "run" while flying. It cost 2 squares of Pace to gain 1 square of height\\
    \textbf{Hollow-boned}\\
    -1 toughness\\
    \textbf{Free Edge}\\
    Start with one free Novice Edge
  \end{redtable}
  
  \hline
      
  \textbf{Bot:} A simple, standard AI hardcoded to single chassis. \textit{\hyperref[sec:specie-bots]{See Species section Bots}}
  \begin{redtable}{\linewidth}{@{}L{1}@{}}
    \textbf{Artificial}\\
    -2 to Charisma when dealing with organic beings. Organics will also generally prefer to deal with an organic "master"\\
    \textbf{Construct}\\
    Add +2 to recover from being Shaken, do not suffer wound modifiers, and you are immune to poison and disease. You are unaffected by vacuum. You cannot Heal naturally, and require the Repair skill to remove wounds (use like the Healing skill)\\
    \textbf{Programmed}\\
    Start with a d6 in a skill of your choice\\
    \textbf{Recharge}\\
    If you cannot access a power source at least once a day, suffer one point of Fatigue each day until incapacitated. The day after that, you go "off-line" and must be revivied with a Repair roll and a four-hour charge. This replaces the need for food and water\\
  \end{redtable}
  
  \hline
  
  \textbf{Ghantak:} Insectiod, beetle-like alien species that are tradition and honour-bound to serve their Queen. Contrary to popular belief, they are not part of a "hive-mind". \textit{\hyperref[sec:specie-ghantak]{See Species section Ghantak}}
  \begin{redtable}{\linewidth}{@{}L{1}@{}}
    \textbf{Carapace}\\

  \end{redtable}
  
  \hline
  
  \textbf{Ghoa:} Violent and combative mammalian-reptilian hybrid alien species. They are all hermaphrodites, with the weaker individuals relegated to birthing duties. \textit{\hyperref[sec:specie-ghoa]{See Species section Ghoa}}
  \begin{redtable}{\linewidth}{@{}L{1}@{}}
    \textbf{Bloodthirsty}\\
    Ghoa are cruel to their foes, rarely take prisoners, and feel little compunction about punishing captured enemies. This causes a -4 Charisma penalty when dealing with "civilised" worlds that know of the Ghoa.\\
    \textbf{Natural Weapons}\\
    The Ghoa use their tails, claws and teeth as weapons, dealing Str+d6 damage.\\
    \textbf{Reptile Blood}\\
    -4 penalty to resist negative Cold environmental effects\\
    \textbf{Stronger}\\
    Start with a d6 in Strength instead of a d4.\\
    \textbf{Free Edge}\\
    Start with one free Novice Edge\\
  \end{redtable}
  
  \hline
  
  \textbf{Human:} Standard human descended from ancient Earth. Some planets have slight physical differences (such as pointed ears, greenish skin, or being short and stout) due to bio-engineering and genetic divergence. \textit{\hyperref[sec:specie-human]{See Species section Human}}
  \begin{redtable}{\linewidth}{@{}L{1}@{}}
    \textbf{Flawed}\\
    Start with a Minor Hindrance of your choice. Do not gain character creation points for this Hindrance\\
    \textbf{Flexible}\\

    Start with one free Novice Edge\\
  \end{redtable}
  
  \hline
  
  \textbf{Pluvma:} Lanky, top-heavy multi-limbed alien species that generally try to stand out from the "pack". \textit{\hyperref[sec:specie-pluvma]{See Species section Pluvma}}
  \begin{redtable}{\linewidth}{@{}L{1}@{}}
    \textbf{One Eye}\\
    -2 to Trait rolls that require depth perception such as Shooting\\
    \textbf{Extra Left Arm}\\

  \textbf{Shell:} An advanced Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) or digitised conciousness (Ghost) that can be freely uploaded to an artificial chassis. \textit{\hyperref[sec:specie-bots]{See Species section Bots}}
  \begin{redtable}{\linewidth}{@{}L{1}@{}}
    \textbf{Bot Base}\\
    Take all of the features listed in the \textbf{Bot} entry\\
    \textbf{Bugs}\\
    Ghosts and AGI do not sync up perfectly with their chassis. Select one Major OR two Minor hindrances that make sense for you and the chassis. Do not gain any character creation points\\
    \textbf{Deus Ex Machina}\\
    Ghosts and AGI do not have any stats. All stats are tied to a chassis. Each chassis has it's own rank and keeps track of its own XP seperate from your Ghost or AGI. Gained XP can be used to buy advancements for the chassis, up until the chassis reaches the next rank (max. 4 advances). Your Ghost or AGI must be of the same rank to pilot a chassis. A chassis cannot improve it's rank (without great cost), whereas your Ghost or AGI can gain ranks normally.\\
    \textbf{Disorientation}\\
    When you are first uploaded into a new chassis, you have a settling period of a few days (4d4 OR at the GM's discretion). If you attempt to do any task during the settling period, apply a -2 penalty\\
    \textbf{Nueron Pathways}\\
    Start with a d6 in the attribute linked to the skill specified in the \textit{Programming} feature\\
  \end{redtable}
  
  \hline

    Many see the Uplifted as inferior to other species that have evolved naturally. -2 Charisma when other characters deal with the Uplifted\\
    \textbf{Primitive Intellect}\\
    You must spend 2 points per step to raise your Smarts during character creation\\
    \textbf{Primal Gift}\\
    You have an ability due to your animal ancestor. Choose one of the following:
      \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Bear:} +1 Size, and +1 Toughness
        \item \textbf{Bovine:} You start with a d6 in Vigor instead of a d4
        \item \textbf{Canine:} +2 to Notice
        \item \textbf{Feline:} Low-light vision (ignore penalities for dim and dark lighting), and +2 to Athletic checks
        \item \textbf{Rodent:} +4 Pace
      \end{itemize}\\
    \textbf{Primal Weapons}\\
    You still have the claws, teeth, horns or other leftovers from your primitive animal state. These natural weapons do Str+d6 damage\\
    \textbf{Free Edge}\\
    Start with one free Novice Edge of their choice\\
  \end{redtable}
  
  \hline

  \item \textbf{Attributes}: You start with a d4 in each attribute and have 5 points with which to raise them. Raising an attribute by one die type costs 1 point (but you cannot raise an attribute above a d12).
    \begin{standardtable}{\linewidth}{@{}L{1}@{}}
      \textbf{Strength}\\
      Raw physical power and general fitness\\
      \textbf{Agility}\\
      Nimbleness, quickness and dexterity\\
      \textbf{Smarts}\\
      Mental agility and your knowledge about the worlds that inhabit the Black\\
      \textbf{Spirit}\\
      Inner wisdom, confidence, individuality and willpower\\
      \textbf{Vigor}\\
      Endurance and a measure of how much pain and physical damage you can shake off
    \end{standardtable}

  \item \textbf{Skills}: You have 15 points for skills. Each die type in a skill costs 1 point up to the linked attribute. Going over the linked attribute costs 2 points per level. A seperate list of skills is provided in it's own section.

  \item \textbf{Derived Traits}: Calculate your derived traits according using your attributes and skills.
    \begin{standardtable}{\linewidth}{@{}L{1}@{}}
      \textbf{Charisma}\\
      Calculated as: \textbf{(Spirit / 2) - 4}. General likeability and manners, and is added to all persuasion and streetwise rolls\\
      \textbf{Pace}\\
      Calculated as: \textbf{(Strength / 2) + 2}. How many squares of movement you can take during your turn\\
      \textbf{Parry}\\
      Calculated as: \textbf{(Fighting / 2) + 2}. Target number for melee combat or against ranged weapons within melee range\\
      \textbf{Toughness}\\
      Calculated as: \textbf{(Vigor / 2) + 2}. Add armour on top of toughness\\
    \end{standardtable}

  \item \textbf{Hindrances}: You can choose to gain additional character creation points by taking up to \textbf{one} Major Hindrace (2 points) and up to \textbf{two} Minor Hindrances (1 point each).
    \begin{itemize}
        \item For 2 points you can gain another attribute point or choose an \textbf{Edge}.
        \item For 1 point you can gain another skill point or increase starting funds by 100\%.
    \end{itemize}

  \item \textbf{Edges}: Edges are what sets your character apart from everyone else. There are 3 main paths to choose from:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Standard}: Just use the normal Edge list.
        \item \textbf{Psionic}: Take the \textit{Psionic Background} edge and manipulate Space-Time. (\textit{Organics only})
        \item \textbf{Cyberware}: Take the \textit{Cyberware Install} edge and meld flesh with machine.
    \end{itemize}

  \item \textbf{Gear}: All characters start with 750 Credits to buy their equipment with.

  \item \textbf{Background Detail}: Fill in any other details of your character's background. This includes selecting a homeworld, parentage, pre-adventuring career, and known languages. Every character starts knowing the Basic language (generic trade language) and their planetary dialect. Planets with a strong alien presence may have retained knowledge of their alien language. Characters with a d10 Smarts can start with an additional language of their choice.
  
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Advancement}

Experience points are gained by completing a game session (of around 4-6 hours of gaming). Each game session is worth around 1-3 points. Unlike other role-playing games, instead of levels your character has a "\textbf{Rank}". Characters that have earned a higher rank are able to access the better Edges.

\begin{standardtable}{\linewidth}{@{}L{.25}@{}L{.75}@{}}
    \textbf{XP} & \textbf{Rank}\\
    0-19 & Novice\\
    20-39 & Seasoned\\
    40-59 & Veteran\\
    60-79 & Heroic\\
    80+ & Legendary
  \end{standardtable}

Every 5 points accumulated grants the character an Advance (or 4 Advances per Rank). One Advance allows you to do the following:

\begin{itemize}
  \item Gain a new Edge
  \item Increase one skill that is equal to or greater than its linked attribute
  \item Increase two skills that are lower than its linked attribute
  \item Buy a new skill at d4
  \item Increase one attribute (only choose this once per Rank, and no Trait can be raised above a d12)
\end{itemize}
