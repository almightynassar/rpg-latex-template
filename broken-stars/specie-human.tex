There are various types of humans seen in the Black. Some are proud of their genetic lineage tracing all the way back to Sol. Others are escaped clones that were destined to be uploaded with someone else's cortical stack. Even more are genetically altered humans, designed for the specific conditions of their colony during the Pre-Surge days. All of these different varities, no matter how weird or alien, are still considered human.
