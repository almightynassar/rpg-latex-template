\subsection{PEM classification}

The \textbf{Politics - Economics - Migration} (PEM) rating is the standard classification system for political entities. An ATB gives a general overview about the political leanings of the organization without resorting to simplified, one-word labels. The classification uses 3 letters, one for each of the categories of Politics, Economics and Migration.
