  \subsection{Sector Overview}

  Sector Shangra Omega consists of 10 \textit{Core} systems (blue), 6 \textit{Independent} systems (yellow), 3 \textit{Ghan} systems (orange) and possibly up to 8 \textit{Lost} systems (red). The systems that surround Shangra Omega are largely unexplored, and Pre-Surge star charts are severely out of date. The sector map used by navigators today are the result of intrepid explorers braving the Black and re-charting the stars.

  \subsection{Core Systems}

  \textbf{The Core} is the name given to the systems that make up the \textbf{United Planets}, a loose federation of star systems that share a common legal framework and similar military structures. Planets, Habitats, Space Stations and Star Systems are allowed to largely govern themselves, but are subject to Universal Decrees voted upon by the United Systems Council. Each star system that has a habitable planet sends 10 Delegates to the Council (regardless of the number of planets, colonies, space stations, or other habitation in that system), and Delegates do not necessarily need to be democratically appointed.
  
  \begin{genericsection}{Al-Taleqani}
  The most populous star system and a cultural force in the known Black. If you want to find something special, odds are that you can find it in Al-sahhah (the main planet, boasting a population of over 1 billion citizens). Despite it's arabic name, the sector is culturally diverse and boasts the largest population of Ay-Matak in the sector. Many across the Black make their way to Al-Taleqani in the hopes of striking it rich in the mines of Khadim, in a popular Al-Rhul Productions sim-sense experience, or in the hustle and bustle of the streets of Al-sahhah.
  
  The prominent idealogy of the system generally focuses on liberty, individual freedoms and the unity and growth of the United Planets.
  \end{genericsection}
  
  \begin{genericsection}{Careeno}
  Commonly known as the "\textit{Blue Collar System}", Careeno is largely known for it's primary industries. In the skies above Raghd are the large space craft manufactories, along the plains of Mahats are the farms that feed billions, and on Polypheme hums the factories that keep our economy going. As the second most populous system in the United Planets (and a industrial powerhouse), Careeno has enough political clout to challenge the powerful Al-Taleqani Delegates in the Council.
  
  The prominent idealogy of the system generally focuses on issues that affect the industrial and agricultural working class. This means that the populace strongly leans towards unions, universal healthcare and other forms of workplace protections.
  \end{genericsection}
  
  \begin{genericsection}{Eurymedon}
  Eurymedon is the most curious system in United Planets. On the one side is Aerope, known for it's fear of foriegners and outsiders. And on the other side is Olaria, known for being open to almost everyone and every idea. In between the two is Nishtha, an Olarian colony that is really only known for it's intact Pre-Surge ruins that serve as a pilgramage site for Pre-Surge enthusiasts. Despite the heated arguments and debates between Aerope and Olaria, war has never threatened the system.
  
  Idealogy largely depends on the planet. Aerope is largely isolationist, joining the United Planets reluctantly so that they could enjoy the protection and economy of the Federation (however the planetary government is rather lax in enforcing United Planet laws, especially those regarding psionics). Olaria (and Nishtha) embraces virtually everything.
  \end{genericsection}
  
  \begin{genericsection}{Heraclitus}
  Parezi is one of the few habitated airless planets in the Sector, and it is reknowned for it's bubble cities that sprawl across it's surface. The system itself is devoted to mining the mineral dense asteroid fields and gas giants. 
  
  Although the system was largely founded by Al-Taleqani entreprenuers, the working class find a lot in common with the citizens of Careeno. As such, the people are split in their loyalties to these two political powerhouses.
  \end{genericsection}
  
  \begin{genericsection}{Ianassa}
  Ianassa is known around the Black for it's partially intact Pre-Surge archive on Hildegunn. This has led to many Universities, Academies and corporate R\&D departments being established on the planet, devoted to unlocking the secrets of the past. The quarantined planet Androcles is also in the system, locked away because the unstable magnetosphere and severe weather patterns have marooned many space craft on it's barren surface. There are rumours that there is another Pre-Surge archive on Androcles, but that it contains dangerous knowledge that could destroy the Sector.
  
  The ideology of the system largely focuses on knowledge, education and academic merit.
  \end{genericsection}
  
  \begin{genericsection}{Mandad}
  The most heavily regulated and restricted system in the United Planets. Primitive sentient aliens were discovered on Aranzta, leading to the Arantza government to the policy of non-interference and dedicating large reserves for the primitives to inhabit. And on Merlo is one of the last remaining refuges for Psionic schools, and the only one to be found in the United Planets. Because of a latent fear of psionics and the possibility that they will bring about the Surge, Merlo is quarantined and it's Psionics heavily regulated.
  
  On Aranzta, the population see that their non-interference methods follow in the path of Pre-Surge civilisations and see themselves the traditional inheritors of the past. Merlo, on the other hand, wants dramatic government reforms when it comes to the issue of Psionics.
  \end{genericsection}
  
  \begin{genericsection}{Penthus}
  Pethus is the only Christian-ruled system in the sector. Bergthora clung to it's faith after the Surge, although it's teachings are different to classical Catholicism due to theological drift. An on-going problem with pirates from the Shakoor system led to the colonisation of Semera, a military output designed to ward off undesirables.
  
  The ideology of the system largely revolves around conservatism, religious ideas and traditional values.
  \end{genericsection}
  
  \begin{genericsection}{Pheegus}
  Pheegus is usually seen as a tourist destination for the citizens of the United Systesm. Ballesteros is an ocean planet that boasts huge floating cities filled with assorted activities for visitors to do. It also strictly maintains it's Pre-Surge sea-faring culture in an effort to preserve it's past, although some cynics see the cultural shows and festivals as another way to fleece credits from tourists. Orithyia is also a tourist destination but because it boasts the largest population of Altered Humans. Orithyia is known across the Black for it's "Freak shows".
  \end{genericsection}
  
  \begin{genericsection}{Yafiah}
  A common saying across the Black is "\textit{All Bank Accounts leads to Mecisteus}". The sole planet of the Yafiah system has built a reputation as a financial powerhouse. This is mainly due to it's strong protection and privacy laws, which allows corporations and individuals to safely and securely horde their credits.
  \end{genericsection}
  
  \begin{genericsection}{Zena}
  While Al-Taleqani and Careeno are the superpowers of interstellar politics, Zena is the close third. It's position in the middle of the United Systems' territory has meant that it has become the undisputed Trade Hub. It boasts respectable spaceyards in orbit above Marider, while Thurid is known for it's industrial output and trading stations.
  
  It's ideology is varied as the population values it's role as the "arbiter" of interstellar politics, often becoming the deciding vote between the Al-Taleqani and Careeno blocs.
  \end{genericsection}
  
  \subsection{Independent Systems}

  Independent systems are those that choose to remain seperate from the United Systems. Some chose not to join because they feel that the strict 10 Delegates per system would unfairly discriminate their large populations. Others stay away because the Decrees do not align with their local laws and customs. And some wish to remain as black market havens. Whatever the reason, Independent systems are considered the "Wild West" of the Black.
  
  \begin{genericsection}{Sakeena}
  Sakeena is a largely self-sufficient star system that strictly follows a protectionist foriegn policy. They see the United Systems as a threat to their sovereignity, and actively work to make sure the United Systems do not interfere with their 'sphere of influence'. Many think that the Sakeena system actively encourages the tensions within the Mahallati and Yongheng systems so that they cannot join the United Systems.
  \end{genericsection}
  
  \begin{genericsection}{Yongheng}
  The planet Vargos in the Yongheng system is embroiled in a decades long civil war. The war originally broke out after the planet Theano was colonised, with six factions claiming ownership. The six factions are: Associated States of Yongheng, Federated States of New Shanghai, South Sodality, Theano Pact, Union of Vargos, and the Vargos Commonality. Vargos itself has been spared the ravages of war as most fighting is done on the surface of Theano, with each faction fighting over patches of territory on the planets surface.
  \end{genericsection}

  \subsection{Ghan Systems}
  
  Ghan systems are, quite simply, the home systems for the Ghantak. Ghan Prime has the homeworld of Ghan, and the Ghantak were able to colonise (at least) two other star systems before the Surge. These systems have all managed to survive the Surge and re-establish contact with each other, but choose to remain seperate from the United Systems. They are led by an Empress who resides in Ghan Prime, but each planet is governed by a Hive Queen that has the freedom to do as she pleases.

  \subsection{Lost Systems}
  
  Lost systems are those that are speculated to still exist, but no formal communication or expedition exist to explore them fully. Travel to the Lost systems are fraught with danger, as many do not return.

  \subsection{Tech-Levels}
  \label{sec:sector-tech-levels}

  Tech-Levels are a standard way to catergorise the differing manufacturing capabilities of a planet. Some worlds are purposely kept at low tech-levels as they provide primary trade resources for high tech-level worlds (such as agriculture).
  
  To see how Gear and Tech-Levels relate to each other, please refer to the \textit{\hyperref[sec:gear-rules]{Gear Tech-Level section}}

    0 & Stone & Stone, human power\\
    1 & Ancient & Metals, domestic animals, steam engine\\
    2 & Industrial & Fossil fuels, factories, simple machines\\
    3 & Mechanized & Computers, satellites, 20th century era tech\\
    4 & Interstellar & IDD, energy weapons, cyberware \\
    5 & Advanced & Specialized knowledge in a technological field\\
