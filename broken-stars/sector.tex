  \subsection{Star Systems}

  Sector Shangra Omega consists of 10 \textit{Core} systems (blue), 6 \textit{Independent} systems (yellow), 3 \textit{Ghan} systems (orange) and possibly up to 8 \textit{Lost} systems (red). The sectors that surround Shangra Omega are largely unexplored, and ancient star charts are severely out of date. The sector map used by navigators today are the result of intrepid explorers braving the Black and re-charting the stars.

  Core systems are those that make up the \textbf{United Systems}, a loose federation of star systems that share a common legal framework and similar military structures. Planets and Star Systems are allowed to govern themselves, but are subject to Universal Decrees voted upon by the United Systems Council. Each star system sends 10 Delegates to the Council (regardless of the number of planets, colonies, space stations, or other habitation in that system), and Delegates do not necessarily need to be democratically appointed.

  Independent systems are those that choose to remain seperate from the United Systems. Some chose not to join because they feel that the strict 10 Delegates per system would unfairly discriminate their large populations. Others because the Decrees do not align with their local laws and customs. And some wish to remain black market havens. Whatever the reason, Independent systems are considered the "Wild West" of the Black.

  Ghan systems are, quite simply, the home systems for the Ghantak. Ghan Prime has the homeworld of Ghan, and the Ghantak were able to colonise (at least) two other star systems before the Surge. These systems have all managed to survive the Surge and re-establish contact with each other, but choose to remain seperate from the United Systems. They are led by an Empress who resides in Ghan Prime, but each planet is governed by a Hive Queen that has the freedom to do as she pleases.

  Lost systems are those that are speculated to still exist, but no formal communication or expedition exist to explore them fully. Travel to the Lost systems are fraught with danger, as many do not return.

  \subsection{Tech-Levels}
  \label{sec:sector-tech-levels}

  Tech-Levels are a standard way to catergorise the differing manufacturing capabilities of a planet. Some worlds are purposely kept at low tech-levels as they provide primary trade resources for high tech-level worlds (such as agriculture).
  
  To see how Gear and Tech-Levels relate to each other, please refer to the \textit{\hyperref[sec:gear-tech]{Gear Tech-Level section}}

  \begin{standardtable}{\linewidth}{ssb}
    \textbf{Level} & \textbf{Description} & \textbf{Example}\\
    0 & Stone & Stone, human power\\
    1 & Ancient & Metals, domestic animals, steam engine\\
    2 & Industrial & Fossil fuels, factories, simple machines\\
    3 & Mechanized & Computers, satellites, 20th century era tech\\
    4 & Interstellar & IDD, energy weapons, cyberware \\
    5 & Advanced & Specialized knowledge in a technological field\\
    6 & Pre-Surge & Psionic tech, TDD, exotic tech\\
  \end{standardtable}

  \subsection{ATB classification}

  The \textbf{Atmospheric - Temperature - Biosphere} (ATB) rating is the standard classification system for worlds, planets and other naturally occuring stellar bodies. An ATB gives a general overview about the suitability for habitation, or at the very least an idea of what risks there are in colonising the world. The classification uses 3 letters, one for each of the categories of Atmosphere, Temperature and Biosphere.

  \subsubsection{Atmosphere}

  \begin{standardtable}{\linewidth}{sb}
    \textbf{Rating} & \textbf{Description} \\
    A (Airless) & Has no to little atmosphere to speak of\\
    B (Breatheable) & A mix of gases that is within the breatheable range for organic beings. Since each planet has different mixtures, foriegners are always aware of the "new world stink"\\
    C (Corrosive) & Dangerously hostile, even with conventional suits and other protective gear. The atmosphere is extremely toxic, and actively corrodes non-native materials\\
    G (Inert Gas) & Atmosphere consists of gases that are not breatheable by organic beings. The atmosphere is otherwise not hostile or poisonous, but requires a constant source of oxygen\\
    T (Thick) & Can be breathed with the aid of a filtration mask. Usually toxic if an organic decides to breathe the air straight over long periods of time\\
    X (Toxic) & These worlds are much more aggressively hostile than corrosive worlds. These worlds have toxic molecules that are able to bypass suit seals during the corrosion process, meaning that they must be purified at regular intervals, reducing the oxygen supply substantially\\
  \end{standardtable}

  \subsubsection{Temperature}

  \begin{standardtable}{\linewidth}{sb}
    \textbf{Rating} & \textbf{Description} \\
    F (Frozen) & Average temperature that is close to absolute zero. Some are so cold that the gases have solidified\\
    C (Cold) & These worlds are uncomfortably cold, but are survivable with suitable heavy clothing\\
    T (Temperate) & These worlds have temperature ranges that are similar to Earth\\
    W (Warm) & These worlds are uncomfortably warm, but are survivable. They are either desert worlds, or have thick, humid jungles\\
    B (Burning) & Average temperatures that is close to boiling. Some are so hot that metals exist in molten form \\
    V (Varied) & These worlds have a wide range of temperatures, either due to unique geological features or varying orbits around their star\\
  \end{standardtable}

  \subsubsection{Biosphere}

  \begin{standardtable}{\linewidth}{sb}
    \textbf{Rating} & \textbf{Description} \\
    R (Remnants) & The wreckage and ruins of a dead ecology\\
    M (Microbial) & Non-sentient micro-organisms that can exist in almost all types of environments (such as slimes, bacteria, fungus). They may or may not be dangerous \\
    Z (None) & For some reason or other, life did not evolve on this world\\
    C (Compatible) & Substantial portion of native life is biologically compatible with human nutritional needs\\
    I (Incompatible) & None of the native life is biologically compatible with human nutritional needs. Microbial life could potentially be highly allergenic to humans\\
    H (Hybrid) & The native flora and fauna have been intermixed with imported species from Earth. They may or may not be compatible, but are not otherwise hostile\\
    E (Engineered) & Are either paradise planets that have been carefully sculpted, or living forges that produce foodstuffs and minerals for trade\\
